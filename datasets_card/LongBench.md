LongBench is the first benchmark for bilingual, multitask, and comprehensive assessment of long context understanding capabilities of large language models. LongBench includes different languages (Chinese and English) to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the large models' multilingual capabilities on long contexts. In addition, LongBench is composed of six major categories and twenty one different tasks, covering key long-text application scenarios such as single-document QA, multi-document QA, summarization, few-shot learning, synthetic tasks and code completion.

LongBench includes 14 English tasks, 5 Chinese tasks, and 2 code tasks, with the average length of most tasks ranging from 5k to 15k, and a total of 4,750 test data. For detailed statistics and construction methods of LongBench tasks, please refer <a href="https://github.com/THUDM/LongBench/blob/main/task.md">here</a>. In addition, we provide LongBench-E, a test set with a more uniform length distribution constructed by uniform sampling, with comparable amounts of data in the 0-4k, 4k-8k, and 8k+ length intervals to provide an analysis of the model's performance variations at different input lengths.
