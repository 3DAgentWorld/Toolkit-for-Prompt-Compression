GSM8K is a dataset of 8.5K high quality linguistically diverse grade school math word problems.

Researchers segmented these into 7.5K training problems and 1K test problems. These problems take between 2 and 8 steps to solve, and solutions primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations (+ - / *) to reach the final answer. A bright middle school student should be able to solve every problem.
