(David M Warren / Staff Photographer) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 100 Occupy Philly protesters sat down on the cold concrete of Dilworth Plaza at 5 p.m. Sunday and waited to be rousted for violating a deadline Mayor Nutter had set for the group to leave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the expected police eviction had not happened by late Sunday evening, and city officials continued to avoid saying when, or whether, they would throw the Occupiers and their tents off City Hall's so-called front lawn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are expecting people to pack up and leave,\" said Mark McDonald, spokesman for Mayor Nutter. \"I'm not going to speculate about what the city might do at any time down the road from now.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For about 90 minutes, protesters chanted slogans such as, \"What does democracy look like? This is what democracy looks like.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They served squash soup in paper cups, handed out bottles of water, and railed against what they believe is excessive corporate greed and power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All the while, police looked on calmly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police had no plans to evict anyone, Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan said about 6:30 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem. Confrontation is never good. Anyone who is being fair would have to say that there is a big difference between the police reaction to Occupy Philadelphia than in other cities,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I definitely, definitely want to really stress that the vast majority of people participating in this movement have been cooperative, nonviolent, and very respectful,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sullivan cautioned, however, that protesters would be prevented from setting up another camp elsewhere in the city unless they got a permit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The city has said it needs to erect fencing this week for work at Dilworth Plaza, including renovation of the SEPTA tunnels and the addition of grass, a cafe, stage, and winter ice rink. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the last few days, Occupy Philly participants, many homeless, had begun to take down their tents. By 7:15 p.m. Sunday, roughly a third of what originally was about 300 tents were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Darrin Annussek, an unemployed career counselor, and William Tuttle, a student, were folding up Annussek's tent Sunday. Someone had stolen Tuttle's tent, and the men, who got married at Occupy Philly last month, said they probably would move to the Occupy site in Washington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I wanted to protest the fact that corporations have too much control and government hasn't done much to stop it,\" Annussek said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he believed Nutter had exaggerated the health and safety concerns the mayor cited in explaining why he could not issue protesters a permit for a new location once the $50 million renovation project began. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I really thought this would become one of the longer occupations,\" Annussek said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ellen Rogovinhart of Elkins Park said she thought the city could have done more to help the Occupiers find a new location, possibly in a church. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I know the city has work to do,\" Rogovinhart said. \"But I think this is a very important movement.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She was hoping Philadelphia police would not use force, as police in Oakland and other cities have, to get Occupiers to move. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rogovinhart held a sign that read, \"The eyes of the world are watching to see if we are the city of brotherly and sisterly love today.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At times it seemed the whole world were watching. On Sunday night, hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, using the screen name @Uncle Rush, went on Twitter to ask Nutter to \"remember this is a nonviolent movement - please show restraint tonight.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nutter tweeted back that he agreed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the west side of City Hall, several hundred people gathered to observe what would happen to those risking arrest. The crowd used its \"human mic\" system of amplification, in which others repeat what each person says so all could hear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I went to college. I graduated with honors,\" Marcel Williams Foster yelled, and the crowd repeated. \"I work three part-time jobs with no benefits and I have $50,000 in student loans.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lauren Keiser, 26, a student from Audubon, said she was willing to get arrested because she believed homeless people, who are a constant presence on the plaza, deserve more help. She thinks the money that will transform Dilworth could be better spent on housing, addiction programs, and other services.\nPassage 2:\nThe LAPD early Monday declared an unlawful assembly on the streets surrounding City Hall and ordered Occupy L.A. protesters to immediately disperse or face arrest.

The Occupy Los Angeles encampment at City Hall Park is seen before the midnight deadline for eviction from City Hall Park passes in Los Angeles, November 27, 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Police in riot gear closed in before dawn on Monday on anti-Wall Street activists in Los Angeles who defied a midnight deadline to vacate a camp outside City Hall, but stopped short of clearing the encampment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police managed to reopen blocked streets for morning rush-hour commuters after a tense standoff with protesters who had taken over a downtown intersection, but remnants of a crowd that had swelled to 2,000 overnight remained at City Hall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four demonstrators were arrested during the brief confrontation, accused of being present at an unlawful assembly, before police ultimately pulled back from City Hall park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later, attorneys for Occupy LA asked a federal judge for an injunction barring police from evicting the camp, arguing that Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and police chief Charlie Beck had violated their civil rights by ordering it dismantled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Los Angeles encampment, which officials had tolerated for weeks even as other cities moved in to clear out similar camps, is among the largest on the West Coast aligned with a 2-month-old national Occupy Wall Street movement protesting economic inequality and excesses of the U.S. financial system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Villaraigosa eventually gave protesters until just after midnight to remove their tents and leave or face a forcible removal, setting the stage for the latest showdown between leaders of a major U.S. city and the Occupy movement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But about two hours after the eviction deadline had passed, police commanders said they would permit the Occupy LA encampment to stay until at least daybreak. Police Commander Andrew Smith later said he thought it was \"highly unlikely\" that the camp would be forced to shut down on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elsewhere in the country, a 5 p.m. Sunday deadline set by Philadelphia officials for Occupy protesters there to move from a similar encampment came and went without incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dozens of people heeded the order but many tents and other structures stayed put. Police sources said authorities were hoping the rest of the protesters would relocate voluntarily and that no major actions were expected before Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'WHOSE STREET? OUR STREET!' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Staking its place since October 1 on the grounds surrounding City Hall, the Los Angeles camp had grown to roughly 400 tents and 700 to 800 people, organizers and municipal officials said. At least a third of campers were believed to be homeless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Sunday night the size of the crowd outside City Hall swelled further as supporters from organized labor, clergy, civil rights and other groups streamed into the area, answering a call for an 11th-hour show of support. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The overall number of protesters, some wearing gas masks, had grown to at least 2,000 by late Sunday, police estimated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After keeping out of sight throughout the day on Sunday, police began to make their presence known as the mayor's eviction deadline passed, and the protesters' mood turned from calm and festive to rowdy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Demonstrators and police confronted each other overnight but except for some debris thrown by protesters at one point, there was no violence. One skirmish involved an intersection occupied by protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Minutes after ordering protesters in the street to disperse, dozens of helmeted police carrying night sticks and special shotguns for firing \"bean-bag\" projectiles enclosed the intersection and forced their way into the crowd. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most in the crowd quickly retreated into the park, as onlookers chanted \"Whose street? Our Street\" at police and shouted at those defying police to \"Get off the street!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Someone hurled what appeared to be pieces of a bamboo pole and a bottle at police, and Smith said four people were arrested. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Los Angeles has been relatively accommodating to its Occupy group compared to other major cities, with Villaraigosa at one point providing ponchos to campers when it rained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But after the collapse of negotiations aimed at persuading protesters to relocate voluntarily, the mayor said last week the encampment would have to go. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mayor complimented the protesters on Sunday for staying peaceful. But he added in a statement: \"It is time for Occupy LA to move from focusing their efforts to hold a particular patch of park land to spreading the message of economic justice and restoration of balance to American society.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he hoped to avoid the sporadic violence that erupted in other cities when police used force against Occupy protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A number of protesters early on Monday credited the police with showing restraint, including Clark Davis, an Occupy LA organizer, who said to Smith and a group of other officers standing by, \"You guys have been fantastic.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Writing by Steve Gorman and Dan Whitcomb; Additional reporting by Lucy Nicholson and Dave Warner in Philadelphia; Editing by Greg McCune and Cynthia Johnston)\n", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park. Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died last month aged 94, wrote a long emotional letter to Patriarch Kirill in May 2012, church officials say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he was suffering \"spiritual pain\" over the many deaths it caused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov had previously refused to accept responsibility for those killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Devilish desires' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis The letter published by Izvestia provides a fascinating insight into the mind of the man who created Russia's most famous weapon. Mikhail Kalashnikov spent his career designing and perfecting assault rifles. More than 100 million Kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide. The gun brought Kalashnikov fame and a string of awards. But his letter to the Patriarch suggests that, towards the end of his life, Kalashnikov felt a degree of guilt - or \"spiritual pain\" as he puts it - for having invented a killing machine. It's unclear, though, how much of this he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a letter, published in Russia's pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia, he wrote: \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths?\" he asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The longer I live,\" he continued, \"the more this question drills itself into my brain and the more I wonder why the Lord allowed man to have the devilish desires of envy, greed and aggression\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The letter is typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, and is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Kalashnikov, or AK-47, is one of the world's most familiar and widely used weapons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its comparative simplicity made it cheap to manufacture, as well as reliable and easy to maintain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is thought that more than 100 million Kalashnikov rifles have been sold worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov refused to accept responsibility for the many people killed by his weapon, blaming the policies of other countries that acquired it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin attended Kalashnikov's funeral in December NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, pride in his invention was tempered with sadness at its use by criminals and child soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is painful for me to see when criminal elements of all kinds fire from my weapon,\" Kalashnikov said in 2008.

Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The press secretary for the Russian Patriarch, Cyril Alexander Volkov, told the paper the religious leader had received Kalashnikov's letter and had written a reply. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it,\" Mr Volkov was quoted as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov received many Russian state honours, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour, but made little money from his gun.

(AP Photo/Natalia Kolesnikova, Pool, file) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mikhail Kalashnikov, designer of the legendary AK-47 assault rifle, turned to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church shortly before his death to express fears he was personally guilty for those it killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov, who died in December at the age of 94, in April wrote a lengthy emotional letter to Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill, Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, reported on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" he asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The typed letter on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, reproduced by Izvestia, is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov, whose funeral was attended by President Vladimir Putin, came up with the durable and simple rifle design after experiencing the Red Army's dire lack of weapons during World War II. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now the AK-47 is widely manufactured unlicenced around the world and has become a visual hallmark of armed insurgent movements, including those using child soldiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kalashnikov wrote that he first went into a church at the age of 91 and was later baptised.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Russian Orthodox Church has sought to consolidate its new-found strength after the Soviet era by building up close ties with state agencies and powerful officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Kalashnikov was feted by the Soviet authorities, it would have been unthinkable for him to have declared himself anything else than an atheist.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "length": 1377, "dataset": "multi_news", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0cd7b0bfc70d78aa6805925975d9fb26b281c482ff482b7c"}

Hernandez, 39, was shot... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would be 33 minutes before Transportation Security Administration Officer Gerardo Hernandez, who was about 20 feet from an exit, would be wheeled out by police to an ambulance, said the officials, who were briefed on the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity because the probe was still ongoing into the Nov. 1 shooting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For all but five of those minutes, there was no threat from the suspected gunman _ he had been shot and was in custody, they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While it's not known when Hernandez died or if immediate medical attention could have saved his life, officials are examining what conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter and whether paramedics could have gone into the terminal earlier, one of the officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Formal conclusions may take months to reach, but what's known raises the possibility that a lack of coordination between police and fire officials prevented speedy treatment for Hernandez and other victims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TSA workers at LAX have been wondering the same thing, said Victor Payes, who works at the airport and is president of the local union. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I basically think there's a lack of coordination between entities at this airport. That lack of coordination may have led to something that shouldn't have happened,\" Payes said. \"We may be talking about Officer Hernandez as a survivor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives for the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department and Los Angeles Airport Police said they couldn't comment on the ongoing investigation until extensive reports are finished.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities say that Paul Ciancia entered Terminal 3 with a duffel bag, pulled out an assault rifle and started shooting. They said he had a note in his bag that said he wanted to \"kill TSA\" and that he wanted to stir fear in them, criticizing their searches as unconstitutional. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was shot by airport police officers four times, in the mouth and leg, before being taken into custody. He remains in fair condition at a hospital and his doctors will determine when he's fit to appear in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the chaotic moments after the gunfire began, as travelers dove to the ground or scrambled for cover in restaurants and stores, officials worried there could be bombs in the terminal and tried to determine whether the gunman had any accomplices. In the first 30 minutes, there was also an unfounded report of two suspicious people on an adjacent parking garage roof, one of the officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officers from multiple agencies bent down to check on Hernandez before moving on, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police broadcast over their radios that Ciancia was in custody at 9:25 a.m., five minutes after Hernandez was shot in the chest. That's when a nearly 26-year veteran Los Angeles police officer checked on Hernandez several times, repeatedly telling officers who came by from various agencies \"he's dead,\" according to one of the law enforcement officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's unclear whether the officer was qualified to determine Hernandez was dead. No officers rendered first aid on scene, according to surveillance video reviewed by the officials. Finally, airport police put Hernandez in a wheelchair and ran him to an ambulance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trauma surgeon David Plurad said Hernandez had no signs of life when he arrived at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Doctors worked for about an hour to revive him despite significant blood loss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When somebody is shot and they're bleeding to death, lifesaving skills need to be implemented immediately, in a couple minutes, and they're very simple, pressure dressings, tourniquets, adequate bandages to stop the bleeding,\" said Dr. Lawrence E. Heiskell, an emergency physician for 27 years and a reserve police officer for 24 years who founded the state and federally approved International School of Tactical Medicine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Responding to a situation with a shooter on the loose has changed since the 1999 Columbine school massacre, when officials huddled outside to formulate a plan while shooters continued firing inside and a teacher bled to death without timely treatment. Now police immediately charge in to stop the shooting as quickly as possible; officers are trained to step over the wounded and stop the gunman first, then tend to victims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During active shooter training last month with the LAX police and LAPD, Los Angeles city firefighters wearing ballistic vests and helmets dragged survivors to areas where they could provide treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because police are often the first at the scene where there are injuries, California law requires officers receive first aid and CPR training in the academy and regular refreshers afterward.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Tuesday that she had met with deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, the first contact he has had with an independent official since he was taken into military custody almost a month ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By allowing the meeting, Egypt’s military signaled that it may be willing to work with Morsi toward a political solution to the country’s ongoing crisis, which has spawned repeated violence between security forces and the ousted president’s supporters. Ashton, a low-key British diplomat, said she was taken by military helicopter late Monday to meet with Morsi. She declined to go into detail about her two-hour conversation with him, but she said he had access to newspapers and television and was in good condition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He’s well, and we had a friendly and open and very frank discussion,” Ashton said at a brief news conference Tuesday. She told reporters that she did not know precisely where Morsi, who has been held incommunicado since his July 3 ouster, is being detained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, prosecutors announced that Morsi is under investigation over allegations of espionage and murder, accusations that his supporters in the Muslim Brotherhood have dismissed as politically motivated. Criminal charges based on the allegations could carry the death penalty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After her meeting with Morsi, Ashton met Tuesday with Egypt’s interim vice president, Mohamed ElBaradei, a liberal leader and key interlocutor for the military-backed interim government. He said at a joint appearance with Ashton that he thought Morsi had “failed” during his year in power but that his Muslim Brotherhood allies should be part of the new political “road map” going forward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We would very much like them to be part of the political process,” said ElBaradei, a Nobel laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency who has been slow to criticize the security forces’ crackdown on pro-Morsi demonstrations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ashton’s two-day visit appeared to have at least temporarily calmed the tense capital after a weekend of violence left at least 80 pro-Morsi demonstrators and a police officer dead, according to the Health Ministry. Morsi’s supporters rallied in Cairo on Tuesday night and marched toward the military intelligence headquarters, although no violence had been reported by early Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During her trip, Ashton met with a wide range of Egyptian political figures, including Gen. Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, the commander of the armed forces; liberal activists and politicians who supported the coup; and a hard-line Islamist party that backed Morsi’s removal but has since wavered in its support for the military. She also met with representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ashton said Monday that she hoped the meetings would facilitate conversations that might lead to a political solution. But she stressed that Egyptians, and particularly those in power, must ensure that the country moves forward along a democratic path. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In all of my conversations, we have emphasized a few things,” Ashton said. “First of all, we are here to help. We are not here to impose. The people of Egypt will determine their own future.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although Ashton has sometimes struggled during her E.U. tenure to publicly articulate a unified message on behalf of the bloc’s 28 member nations, she is known as a charming envoy behind closed doors. She has previously been involved in tough international negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Cairo on Tuesday, her reticence about the substance of her conversation with Morsi appeared at least partly intended to help jump-start discussions between the interim government and the ousted Brotherhood-backed leaders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials from the Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, from which Morsi hails, told Ashton that any political solution for Egypt must be based on “the return of the president,” the party said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The statement said the demonstrations in support of Morsi would not stop until “constitutional legitimacy” was restored. His backers have used that phrase to refer to returning him to power, as well as to reinstating the country’s Islamist-dominated parliament and the constitution ratified under Morsi through a popular referendum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke by telephone Tuesday with Sissi, a Hagel spokesman said, adding that the secretary urged “restraint” in dealing with protesters and called for “an inclusive reconciliation process.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sharaf al-Hourani contributed to this report.\n", "answers": ["Under circumstances that sound straight out of a Le Carre novel, Mohamed Morsi has met with an outsider for the first time since being dumped by Egypt's military, holding a midnight meeting with the European Union's top diplomat at an \"undisclosed location\" last night, the Wall Street Journal.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ellen Pao leaves San Francisco Superior Court Civic Center Courthouse during a lunch break in San Francisco, California March 25, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A jury cleared Kleiner Perkins in March of claims it short-circuited former partner Ellen Pao’s career because she is a woman. The trial helped spark a wide discussion about gender at the center of the U.S. technology industry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kleiner has offered to waive its legal costs should Pao choose not to appeal, according to firm spokeswoman Christina Lee. Kleiner’s costs request includes about $865,000 in expert witness fees, the court filing said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We believe that women in technology would be best served by having all parties focus on making progress on the issues of gender diversity outside of continued litigation,” Lee said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pao and her legal team are considering the proposal, said Heather Wilson, a spokeswoman for Pao. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pao, now interim chief executive at social-news service Reddit, claimed her standing at Kleiner Perkins crumbled after she ended a brief affair with a partner. Her career deteriorated after he and Kleiner Perkins started retaliating against her in a climate that was overall unfriendly toward women, her lawyers argued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the verdict, three jurors told Reuters they had focused on Pao’s increasingly negative performance reviews, which undermined her argument that she deserved to be promoted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kleiner’s offer to withdraw its costs request in exchange for an end to the case, is common when defendants prevail in employment lawsuits. Should Pao decide to pursue an appeal, her case would be heard by California’s First District Court of Appeal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Westlaw data, out of 49 decisions involving discrimination and retaliation over the past two years, the First District affirmed 26 of 31 cases where the employer won in the trial court, or 84 percent. Only five cases were reversed.

The firm said the case, which drew an abundance of unfavorable attention to its inner workings and the fate of women in Silicon Valley, cost it $972,815 in witness fees, deposition and court reporter costs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the winning party, Kleiner is asking the former associate, Ellen Pao, to reimburse it for these bills.

Ms. Pao has not said whether she will pursue an appeal, and the grounds on which she would do so are uncertain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge in the case, Harold Kahn, made no obvious rulings that seemed to favor the defense. If anything, the opposite was true. He declined to allow testimony about Ms. Pao’s husband, Alphonse Fletcher Jr., whose hedge fund is bankrupt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Debra S. Katz, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who specializes in gender discrimination suits, said Kleiner sounded a little punitive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If Kleiner wanted to look classy, it could have said, ‘This was hard fought and we obviously disagree with your view, but it’s in the interest of all parties to walk away. In the meantime, there have been lessons learned and we are going to fund organizations that focus on glass ceiling issues,’ ” Ms. Katz said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jack McCullough, 76, was serving a life sentence for the 1957 murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was freed shortly after the hearing and was whisked away in a car driven by a family member. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the judge's ruling, McCullough turned toward his stepdaughter, Janey O'Connor, and flashed her a private signal that she says means \"I love you.\" She was seated behind him and broke into tears but managed a big smile back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria Ridulph's murder went unsolved for half a century. Then detectives pursued a tip, and a man was brought to trial and convicted in the 1957 murder of the 7-year-old in Sycamore, Illinois. Now that man is free. Ann O'Neill's 2013 series on the case, \"Taken,\" raised questions about whether the trial was unfairly one-sided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Across the aisle, Charles Ridulph, the older brother of the victim, frowned and bowed his head. More than 58 years ago, he helped search for Maria after she vanished from a street corner near their home while playing in the snow with a friend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough's lawyers and DeKalb County state's attorney Richard Schmack argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough has long insisted that he couldn't possibly have abducted and killed the child because he was 40 miles away in Rockford, Illinois, talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force when she was taken. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He repeated the alibi when he spoke with CNN in prison in March 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They proved nothing,\" he said at the time. \"I am in here for murder. A murder I would not, could not have done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough said that when Maria was kidnapped, the telephone in his home in Sycamore was ringing.

Only Scotty could make that happen, if he beamed me up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jack McCullough, in prison after his 2012 conviction. Now a judge has ordered him freed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An Illinois appeals court upheld his conviction last year. But McCullough made a last-ditch appeal in a jailhouse motion last December, saying police and prosecutors buried evidence supporting his alibi. He asked a judge to find him innocent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, who inherited the case from predecessor Clay Campbell, was placed in the position of having to defend the conviction. He launched a six-month investigation that included a review of some 4,500 pages of documents -- old police and FBI reports, grand jury transcripts, trial transcripts, affidavits for search and arrest warrants, and even CNN's five-part series on the case, \"Taken,\" which raised questions about whether the courtroom reconstruction of history was unfairly one-sided. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack concluded that he'd found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough had been convicted of a crime he didn't commit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The precise time of Maria's abduction has been in dispute almost from the beginning.

He gave Maria two piggyback rides, Sigman told police at the time. Sigman, now a grandmother known as Kathy Chapman, said she went home to fetch her mittens. When she returned, Maria and Johnny were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 600 volunteers combed the fields and woods around Sycamore in search of Maria, at times walking hand-in-hand in a grid pattern. And within 24 hours, dozens of FBI agents descended on the small farming community about 65 miles west of Chicago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Agents interviewed some 200 possible suspects -- including McCullough, who passed a polygraph test about his alibi and was cleared. Despite the work of nearly three-dozen FBI agents, the investigation turned up no solid leads to Maria's whereabouts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her body was discovered 144 days later by a couple looking for mushrooms near the Iowa border. She was under a fallen tree, some 100 miles from home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because Maria apparently never left Illinois, the FBI pulled out of the investigation and the case went cold for half a century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Illinois State Police began to look into the Ridulph case again in 2008, after McCullough's half sister, Janet Tessier, emailed a tip. She said her dying mother had pulled her close some 14 years earlier and whispered, \"Those two little girls, and the one that disappeared, John did it. John did it, and you have to tell someone.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough was questioned in Seattle and arrested in late June 2011. A judge hearing the case without a jury found McCullough guilty after a week-long trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, the state's attorney, said he sat through the trial and always doubted whether there was enough evidence to support the conviction. In his review of the case, he said he found new evidence that verified McCullough's long-standing alibi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He subpoenaed records from AT&T and found that a collect call had indeed been placed at 6:57 p.m. to McCullough's home in Sycamore from a pay phone at the post office in downtown Rockford on on December 3, 1957 -- just as McCullough said he had done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At his sentencing, McCullough vehemently professed his innocence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Look in the box. The truth is in the box,\" he said, pointing to a cardboard box in the courtroom. It was filled with old FBI reports and other documents that the judge, James Hallock, kept from the trial, saying it was inadmissible hearsay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutor Richard Schmack reviewed the case and asked for McCullough to go free. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack did look at those documents. He built a timeline based on the statements of 21 people -- Maria Ridulph's family members, friends, neighbors and passersby -- that confirmed the FBI's original timeline ruling out McCullough as a suspect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria was taken that day some time between 6:45 and 7 p.m. -- and not as early as 6 p.m., as alleged during McCullough's trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would have been impossible for him to have been in two places at once. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Campbell, the state's attorney who brought the case, was defeated by Schmack in an election just weeks after McCullough was convicted. Campbell has declined to comment since Schmack released his findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cold cases are particularly difficult to prosecute because evidence is often lost or destroyed, memories fade and witnesses die. And so questions have lingered over the evidence used to convict McCullough -- and whether it was strong enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No physical evidence ties him to the crime.\nPassage 2:\nSYCAMORE, Ill. --A 76-year-old man from Washington state who a prosecutor says was wrongly convicted in the abduction and killing of a 7-year-old Illinois schoolgirl in 1957 will be released from prison, a judge ordered Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WATCH: \"48 Hours:\" Cold as Ice NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hearing, presided over by Judge William P. Brady, was held in Sycamore, about 70 miles west of Chicago and near where Maria Ridulph was abducted as she played in the snow. Forest hikers found the girl's remains five months later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2012, another judge convicted Jack McCullough in Maria's death, in one of the oldest unsolved U.S. cases ever to go to trial. McCullough was sentenced to life in prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough, in handcuffs, appeared shaken by the judge's decision at first, rocking back and forth, then taking a deep breath. Family members behind him hugged and cried. Moments later, McCullough looked back and smiled broadly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the other side of the room, Maria's brother and sister displayed little emotion as the hearing ended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady said McCullough would be released Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge pointed to several factors in his decision, including records that support McCullough's long-held contention that he was about 40 miles away from Sycamore when Maria was abducted. That evidence included newly discovered phone records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn't clear until the last minute the Brady would rule as he did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Rest assured I am not trying this case ... You will not hear the words, 'Mr. McCullough is guilty' or 'Mr. McCullough is not guilty' coming from my mouth.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brady's ruling was prompted by a six-month review of evidence conducted by DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack after the 2012 conviction. Schmack concluded that McCullough could not have killed Maria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's disappearance made headlines nationwide in the 1950s, when reports of child abductions were rare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She had been playing outside in the snow with a friend on Dec. 3, 1957, when a young man approached, introduced himself as \"Johnny\" and offered them piggyback rides. Maria's friend dashed home to grab mittens, and when she came back, Maria and the man were gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At trial, prosecutors said McCullough was Johnny, because he went by John Tessier in his youth. They said McCullough, then 18, dragged Maria away, choked and stabbed her to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack, who wasn't involved in McCullough's case and was elected to the state's attorney post as McCullough's trial came to an end, filed a scathing report with the court last month that appeared to pick the case apart, point-by-point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCullough's long-held alibi was that he was in Rockford, attempting to enlist with the U.S. Air Force at a military recruiting station, on the night Maria disappeared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack said newly discovered phone records proved McCullough had, as he long-claimed, made a collect call to his parents at 6:57 p.m. from a phone booth in downtown Rockford - which is 40 miles northwest of where Maria was abducted between 6:45 p.m. and 6:55 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Schmack also reviewed police reports and hundreds of other documents, including from the Air Force recruitment office, which he said had been improperly barred at trial. In his review he said the documents contained \"a wealth of information pointing to McCullough's innocence, and absolutely nothing showing guilt.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also noted that Maria's friend had identified McCullough as the killer five decades later from an array of six photographs; McCullough's picture stood out, partially because everyone but him wore suitcoats and their photos were professional yearbook pictures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maria's murder haunted the Sycamore for decades, and McCullough's conviction four years ago seemed to bring some closure. Those wounds now threaten to reopen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her family remains convinced that McCullough is guilty and have sought the appointment of a special prosecutor in an attempt to keep him behind bars. Maria's brother, 70-year-old Charles Ridulph, still lives in Sycamore and has said in recent weeks that his family feels let down by the state prosecutor's office about-face.\n", "answers": ["A man convicted four years ago in the oldest cold case ever tried was freed Friday after an Illinois judge vacated his conviction and subsequent life sentence, CNN reports.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump came to Montana on the attack against Tester, a two-term Democratic senator, who is in a close race against Matt Rosendale, the current state auditor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president has made it his mission to unseat Tester, whose office publically released information about alleged misconduct that led to White House physician Adm. Ronny Jackson’s failed nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Jackson denied allegations of misconduct and that he overprescribed medications, but eventually withdrew his name from consideration. Trump never forgot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jonathan Ernst/Reuters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That’s really why I’m here,” Trump said. “I can never forget what Jon Tester did to a man of the highest quality. It was vicious.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president spoke at length about immigration and falsely said that Democrats are supporting a caravan of immigrants traveling up from Central America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They wanted that caravan and there are those who say that caravan didn’t just happen, it didn’t just happen. A lot of reasons that caravan -- 4,000 people -- but I just want to thank the Mexican government because they’re stopping it hopefully before it ever gets to Mexico,” Trump said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As you know, I’m willing to send the military to defend our Southern border if necessary all because of the illegal immigration onslaught brought by the Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge or to change the laws -- they like it,” Trump said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said that the midterm elections will be “an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense -- that’s what it’s going to be.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jonathan Ernst/Reuters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At times, the president veered off script, talking about the first lady’s trip to Africa and controversy over her pith hat (“I think she bought it in Los Angeles!”) and fake allegations he wears a toupee (“He wears a hairpiece”). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then he would swerve back on course to talking about Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren’s DNA test in a state home to many Indian reservations: “It’s too bad because I can’t call her Pocahontas anymore.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Trump comfortably won the Big Sky state by 20 points, Tester, a moderate Democrat, maintains a slight lead in what has become one of the most expensive political contests in the small state’s history as millions of dollars have poured into Montana. It’s the president’s third trip to Montana, and Tester is only a few points ahead of Rosendale in recent polls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tester has touted a bipartisan record in the Senate, even publishing a full-page newspaper ad at the beginning of the summer thanking the president for signing 16 of his bills into law on everything from government waste to veterans affairs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We can’t let Jon Tester and the radical liberal agenda win, they’ll go after President Trump,” Rosendale said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the president’s ire toward Tester is rooted in Jackson, many of the voters ABC News spoke with before the rally began didn't seem to know his name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I really don’t have any thoughts about him,” Jeffrey Stenger from Polson, Montana, told ABC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His wife Lynn jumped in, to remind him he was the White House physician who “got in a spat with Tester.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He has a good instinct of reading people, even in the beginning of the election he called people out and said the truth.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nCigarette smoke has long been known to have a multitude of damaging effects, but thanks to recent research we now know it also fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs. According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia. Originating as a strain of staph infection, MRSA becomes resistant to antibiotics and often affects individuals in hospitals or other health care settings. A disastrous diagnosis due to its innate difficulty to treat, it has become even more threatening with the addition of smoking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, in a press release. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist, sought to find potential ties between the increased occurrences of MRSA cases in smokers. In order to do so, Crotty Alexander and her team tested two groups of MRSA, one exposed to cigarette smoke extract and one not, to see how each group responded to the defenses of our immune system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Macrophages, or immune cells known to devour infectious ages, were infected with both types of MRSA (smoke exposed and not) to test the immune response. Although both were able to take up the populations of MRSA, macrophages fighting MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time killing them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers found that this type of MRSA was more resistant to the reactive oxygen species, a chemical burst macrophages utilize once they have engulfed bacteria. MRSA exposed to smoke extract was also more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, another line of immune defense used to make holes in bacteria and cause inflammation. Even more alarming was researchers’ discovery that MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, assisting in the success of their invasion. This effect depended strongly on dose; the more smoke extract the MRSA was exposed to, the more resistant it became. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ultimately, the data suggest that through altering the cell walls of the bacteria, cigarette smoke allows MRSA to repel common forms of immune responses. Another study conducted by researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine a year earlier suggested something similar with e-cigarette smoke; vaporized smoke can also alter the structure of MRSA’s cell wall to make it more resistant to bacteria. However, this research also discovered that surface changes to the bacteria increased 10 times more with exposure to cigarette smoke rather than e-cigarette vapor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Cigarette smokers are known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Now we have evidence that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor,\" Crotty Alexander said. Through their finding, Crotty Alexander and her team hope to add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In lab studies in human cells and whole mice, MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke extract become harder to kill, said Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crotty Alexander is senior author of the paper, published Monday in the journal Infection and Immunity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study is similar to one published last May, in which the effects of e-cigarette vapor on bacterial resistance was examined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Laura Crotty Alexander led a study that found the superbug MRSA becomes more resistant when exposed to electronic cigarette vapors. Crotty Alexander is a UCSD assistant clinical professor of medicine and staff physician at VA San Diego Healthcare System. — Hayne Palmour IV Share Photo  NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reddit NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ✉ Laura Crotty Alexander led a study that found the superbug MRSA becomes more resistant when exposed to electronic cigarette vapors. Crotty Alexander is a UCSD assistant clinical professor of medicine and staff physician at VA San Diego Healthcare System. — Hayne Palmour IV NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, Crotty Alexander said. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MRSA exposed to the smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA, the study stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, Crotty's team found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worse, the study found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions. At that rate, a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When we put these cigarette smoke-exposed bacteria into mice, there was a significant difference in mortality,\" compared to MRSA that had not been smoke exposed, Crotty Alexander said in a phone interview Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The smoke-exposed MRSA also became better at invading human cells in lab cultures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The cigarette smoke helped the bacteria kill more mice, whereas the e-cigarette vapor was just on the borderline,\" Crotty Alexander said. \"It did make it a little more aggressive, but not as much as the cigarette smoke.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. — NIAID Share Photo  NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR  NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reddit NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ✉ Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a dead human neutrophil. / NIAID NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study stated it was performed to examine an alternative to the prevailing theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker. The alternative is that smoke actually makes the pathogen tougher. The study focused on MRSA and its more sensitive relative MSSA as a good test case for that alternative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Because MRSA causes severe pneumonia more often than MSSA, and because MRSA commonly colonizes the nasopharynx and airways and thus is exposed to inhaled substances, we examined the effect of cigarette smoke on MRSA resistance to host innate immune killing mechanisms and the ability to cause pneumonia in mice,\" the study stated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tests on human cells found the same result, Crotty Alexander said. Previous research has shown that cigarette smoke harms human respiratory and immune cells, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So the picture now is that cigarette smoke both harms smokers and assists pathogens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Study co-authors include Elisa K. McEachern, John H.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe most important person in the English-language world is Frank Sinatra, according to an analysis of Wikipedia articles led by the University of Toulouse's Young-Ho Eom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Number two is Michael Jackson, and number three is Pope Pius XII. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eom arrived at this somewhat surprising conclusion by using methods borrowed from Google to analyse Wikipedia pages and determine which individuals have the most important articles linking to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Taking all 24 major language editions of Wikipedia into account, Eom's team carried out the same study and came to a more plausible conclusion: Adolf Hitler. (Even then, Michael Jackson takes the second slot, and Madonna is in third place.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The point of the study wasn't strictly to determine who the most important people are on Wikipedia, but instead to discover if the online encyclopaedia was skewed in the level of attention it gives to various figures, either by gender, time, or location. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our analysis shows that most important historical ﬁgures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. But, they add, \"each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, so that most of its own historical figures are born in the countries which use the language of the edition. The emergence of such pronounced accent to local figures seems to be natural since there are more links and interactions within one culture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study takes as its starting point Google's PageRank algorithm. This is still the basic method the search engine uses to decide the basic importance of webpages in its index, although the system has received an almost total overhaul since it was first introduced in 1998. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PageRank says that a page is important if a lot of important pages link to it. While the definition sounds self-referential, in practice, it recreates a lot of features which we intuitively understand: the more sites link to a newspaper's website, for instance, the more important that website is; and being linked to from a national newspaper probably says more about a site's importance than being linked to from a nondescript blog. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But when the study applied PageRank to figures on Wikipedia, the results were odd. The most important person in the world comes out as Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist – certainly an important feature in natural history, but possibly not the most important in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It seems the algorithm was thrown by a quirk of Wikipedia: the site contains an almost complete collection of named species – as well as who named them. Since Linnaeus' life work was coming up with a system to classify organisms, and applying that system as widely as possible, he is linked to from a lot of pages, and important ones at that. From the Domestic Cat to the Red Fox, through the mighty Asian elephant and the lowly moss gall, Linnaeus named, and is linked from, them all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To get around that issue, the researchers applied a second way of measuring importance: CheiRank. Simply put, \"the PageRank… of an article is proportional to the number of incoming links, while the CheiRank… of an article is proportional to the number of outgoing links. Thus a top PageRank article is important since other articles refer to it, while a top CheiRank article is highly connected because it refers to other articles.\" In other words, an important person is likely to have a lot of other important people and things involved in their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mix Pagerank and CheiRank together, and you get the final measure: 2DRank. That's how the authors arrived at the top 100 for all 24 editions of Wikipedia – and how Frank Sinatra took pole position. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales: 'It's true, I'm not a billionaire. So?'\nPassage 2:\nThese crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to. That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.The goal is to fix all broken links on the web . Crawls of supported \"No More 404\" sites.\nPassage 3:\nEven Sir Isaac Newton recognized that intellectual success depended on what had come before: \"If I have seen further, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants,” he so famously said. But while we may all wield influence in our own domains, some people (say, the ones who inspired Newton) are just more influential than others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an intriguing new study, a team led by University of Tolouse researcher Young-Ho Eom sought to figure out who, exactly, should be considered the most influential thinker in the world. Trawling through 24 different language editions of Wikipedia, Eom's team calculated whose intellectual fingers stretched out the furthest. The goal was to study who was at the heart of the biggest branching web of links, the page of the person who, if you spent long enough link jumping through Wikipedia's nearly endless treasures, you'd end up on the most. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The result was... somewhat surprising. According to Eom and co., the world's most influential mind was Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. Linneaus beat out everyone, from the Pope to President Obama to Frank Sinatra, Hitler, Caesar—even Jesus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If it's been a while since introductory biology, you may be scratching your head trying to remember who Carl Linnaeus even is. \"The Father of Taxonomy,\" Linneaus invented the scientific system of naming that is still, generally, in use today. It's under Linnaeus' system that human beings became Homo sapiens, and taxonomical gifts like Llama glama, Vini vidivici, Apopyllus now and Ytu brutus came to be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was Linnaeus' particular scientific penchant, combined with the specifics of Young-Ho Eom's method of searching Wikipedia, says New Scientist, that led to the unexpected result: “Linnaeus topped the chart across all languages because there are so many Wikipedia pages with scientific names in every edition, and they all eventually lead back to him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn't the first time people have tried to figure out the influence of various historical people, of course, and Linnaeus is not a reliable entrant on the list. Last year Jasleen Kaur, Filippo Radicchi and Filippo Menczer tried to calculate which academic has had the most influence over the years. Using their approach, which studied how often academics referenced each other in their own work, the team found that Karl Marx was history's most influential scholar.\n", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person. Second place goes to Michael Jackson, and third to Pope Pius XII. When factoring in all 24 language editions of the online encyclopedia, the team found that Adolf Hitler ranked the most important person, while Michael Jackson was again second and Madonna third, reports the Guardian. \"Our analysis shows that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reason for always-on listening mode is simple; Microsoft wants the new Xbox to respond quickly and naturally to you, whenever you need it. To fulfill that goal, the company will ship the new Kinect — its motion-sensing and listening peripheral — with every Xbox One. The new console uses the new Kinect for just about everything: switching between games, movies, web browsing, and live television, all of which can be done with voice commands. (In fact, the new console needs the Kinect to operate at all — it's not an optional add-on like with the Xbox 360.) Even when the console's turned off, users can simply say \"Xbox On\" to power up — which means the new Kinect will be listening to you in your living room at all times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I think it's creepy that you can say \"Xbox on\" and it will turn on. It means it's always listening to you. — Jack Lloyd (@RedDeadLloyd) May 21, 2013 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kinect on the Xbox One is always listening/watching and has a constant connection to the Internet. 1984 anyone? — James Philippon (@jamesphilippon) May 21, 2013 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fact, the new camera and microphone system is so sensitive to your presence, that Microsoft says the new Kinect can even read your heartbeat while you're exercising, and recognize and process audio that's personalized to specific individuals. \"This is rocket science level stuff,\" Xbox's Marc Whitten said during today's reveal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft claims the new Kinect is so sensitive that it can read your heartbeat and recognize individual voices NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, that's not necessarily a gloom-and-doom situation, and listening doesn't mean recording. Still, compared to privacy concerns over a device like Google Glass, which doesn't actively listen to its surroundings at all times, the new Xbox could pose greater privacy implications — especially if the system, which many users will connect to the internet, is compromised remotely by a malicious actor. \"If I'm recording you, I have to stare at you — as a human being,\" Google Glass engineer Charles Mendis told The Verge when asked about Glass' privacy concerns. \"And when someone is staring at you, you have to notice.\" But will you notice a fixed camera in your living room that's always listening? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn't the first time Kinect has faced privacy concerns NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn't the first time Microsoft has dealt with privacy issues related to Kinect. When the first iteration of Kinect headed to the market in 2010, Microsoft's Dennis Durken suggested to investors that the peripheral might pass data to advertisers about how you look, play, and speak. \"We can cater what content gets presented to you based on who you are,\" he said, sparking privacy concerns. (Microsoft later denied that the Kinect would use information for targeted advertising.) But even then, the first Kinect was only enabled in specific situations, and didn't have an always-on listening mode. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft provided few additional details on how the new Kinect will work, but the company did mention that the system will run in an extremely low-power state for listening mode, meaning that the device's operating system and certain hardware features could be disabled in that state. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We've asked Microsoft to clarify the technical specifics of how the system operates in listening mode, and if the company has considered any safeguards against potential privacy threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update: A Microsoft spokesperson responded to our inquiry with the following statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new Kinect is listening for a specific cue, like ‘Xbox on.’ We know our customers want and expect strong privacy protections to be built into our products, devices and services, and for companies to be responsible stewards of their data. Microsoft has more than ten years of experience making privacy a top priority. Kinect for Xbox 360 was designed and built with strong privacy protections in place and the new Kinect will continue this commitment.

(Family photos) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before dinner on July 29, 3-year-old Carter Roberts of Chesterfield, Va., seemed perfectly healthy. That evening, he vomited. When he woke up the next morning with a slight fever of 99 degrees, his mother, Robin Roberts, figured that he was coming down with a cold. The next morning, she found him collapsed on his bedroom floor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mommy,” she recalls him saying. “Help me, help me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carter could barely stand when she picked him up, and his neck was arched backward. “What was most alarming,” she said, “is he had no control over his right arm whatsoever.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the hospital, Carter lost control of his right arm, then over his legs and other muscles within a few days. He now can only wiggle a toe and move the left side of his face. He has been diagnosed with a mysterious, polio-like illness called acute flaccid myelitis, a condition that seems to be surging this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Through July, 32 new cases of AFM have been confirmed across the United States this year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a sharp rise compared with last year, when just seven cases had been confirmed by that month. The numbers have risen steadily since April. In past years, most cases have occurred between August and December, with a peak in October. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s $3 billion scientific effort aims to rid world of major diseases by end of century] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the many unanswered questions about the condition are what causes it, how best to treat it and how long the paralysis lasts. Although most cases occur in children, AFM occasionally affects adults. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CDC official who leads the surveillance efforts said that confirmed numbers for August will not be available until the end of this month, but the number of reports she is receiving from doctors around the country continues to rise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “CDC is looking at these trends very carefully,” Manisha Patel said. “We have sent out several health alerts to states to let them know we are seeing an increase in reporting and to encourage them to communicate with doctors to report these cases in a timely fashion.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CDC began tracking AFM in 2014, when 121 cases were confirmed. That year, the CDC counted only children affected by the disease. Their average age was 7. Most had a fever or a respiratory illness a few days before developing paralysis. Many had to be placed on respirators. Although 85 percent of the children recovered partially, only three of them recovered fully.

It's a major improvement for someone with this polio-like illness. (Facebook/Team Braden Luke) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health officials and physicians around the country said they are concerned that the rising number of cases through July could foretell a repeat of 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You hate to be an alarmist, but there’s reason to have some concern,” said Avindra Nath, chief of the section of infections of the nervous system at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “What we don't know is where are these cases. Are they clustered? Do they all look alike? Getting more information on these cases would be helpful.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beyond saying that confirmed cases have been reported in 17 states through July, Patel declined to reveal which states have been involved. But conversations and emails with physicians around the country indicate that at least four cases have occurred in California and at least three in Massachusetts, and that others have been seen in Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York, as well as Virginia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We are definitely hearing of cases from our colleagues across the country,” said Teri Schreiner, a neurologist at the University of Colorado and Children's Hospital Colorado. “It’s a trend that’s worrisome … what I'm hearing from others seems to be coming at a tempo similar to what happened in 2014.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jean-Baptiste Le Pichon of Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., said that doctors on a U.S. email list for pediatric neurologists reported five new cases of AFM in just the past few days. “There is definitely an explosion of cases,” Le Pichon said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No treatment other than physical therapy has yet been shown to markedly improve outcomes, although some doctors have reported that treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), used to treat some other viral infectious diseases afflicting the nervous system, might help. It’s also been suggested that Prozac could prove beneficial. The degree of paralysis in the first month has generally improved only slightly over the course of a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “After about a year or so, what you’ve got is what you’ve got,” said Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at Case Western Reverse University in Cleveland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most perplexing is what causes the disease. The 2014 outbreak of AFM occurred at the same time as a far larger outbreak of enterovirus D68 across the United States. The vast majority of patients infected with the virus developed only a respiratory illness. Some physicians were convinced that EV-D68 was the cause, not only because both outbreaks occurred at the same time but also because of a study that identified a particular strain of EV-D68 in the airways of children with AFM. But officials at the CDC and some doctors, including Wiznitzer, insist that the cause remains unproved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far this year, no similarly widespread outbreak of EV-D68 respiratory infections has been reported, although cases of it and other enteroviruses have been seen in some areas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Friday, Le Pichon, in Kansas City, said, “I just got confirmation that we have an epidemic of enterovirus breaking out here and at least a few cases [of enterovirus] have typed positive for EV-D68.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Carol Glaser, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., said: “If the theory is right that it’s caused by EV-D68, which some of us believe more than others, this would be the time of year we start seeing it. It’s an enterovirus, and they tend to peak in late summer and early fall.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because the CDC’s surveillance of AFM is less than two years old, it remains unclear if some of this year’s apparent rise in confirmed cases is due simply to more doctors sending in case reports, Patel said. And Wiznitzer emphasized that with just 32 confirmed cases across the United States so far, AFM remains extremely rare NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Glaser, however, said she is convinced that the condition is new. She worked at the California Department of Public Health when, in 2012, some of the first reports of AFM anywhere in the country came in from physicians there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was there for 15 years and talked to neurologists every single day,” she said. “It wasn’t until the fall of 2012 when the first physician called in and wanted a test for polio on one of his patients. One of my colleagues in the office chuckled and said to me, ‘We don't have polio in the United States.’ But in the next two weeks, I got two very similar phone calls. We had never had a report like that. I do think there was something new going on. Fortunately, it’s still rare.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If EV-D68 does somehow cause AFM, studying the virus may lead to prevention or treatment. One glimmer of good news came from Kenneth Tyler, chair of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. He and his colleagues have been conducting experiments to infect mice with EV-D68 and have them develop loss of muscle control like that seen in AFM. He says he has submitted a paper to a peer-reviewed medical journal describing his success in doing so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The goal, he said, is to use mice to study how EV-D68 causes harm to the spinal cord and muscles, and to test potential therapies, such as IVIG. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It looks like we’re seeing protection with IVIG in the mouse model,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robin Roberts said she wishes more was known about the condition that has harmed her son. “In this day and age to not have information about something like this is very frustrating. There needs to be more done about it, and for more parents and doctors to know about it,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Angie Andersen said that her daughter McKenzie was sent home from the hospital twice in the first two weeks of her illness because doctors did not understand the severity of what was happening. Finally her pediatrician told Andersen to bring McKenzie to another hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McKenzie was 6 years old when she developed sniffles in December 2014. “Within 12 days,” Andersen said, “she was paralyzed from the neck down, on a ventilator to breathe for her. She was left with her left hand and her feet and toes that move.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You know you could understand the bad that comes from a car wreck, or if she got cancer,” Andersen said. “How do you ever wrap your brain around the fact that she got a cold, and now she’s a quadriplegic on a ventilator? It’s a nightmare you never wake up from.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, she said, McKenzie can now speak and even sing softly despite having a tracheotomy. “She has a lot of spunk, and that is helping her through,” Andersen said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From Jan. 1 to Aug. 31, 2016, the CDC reported 50 people in 24 U.S. states had been diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), compared with only 21 people in 2015 in 16 U.S. states. From August to December 2014, 120 people, mostly patients 21 and younger, in 34 U.S. states, were diagnosed with the condition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AFM affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, according to the CDC. The cause is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections like polio and non-polio enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Enteroviruses can cause neurologic illness such as meningitis, but more serious disease like encephalitis and AFM are less common. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Symptoms of AFM include pain in the arms and legs, an inability to pass urine, and, most severely, respiratory failure that can occur when muscles involved in breathing become weak. The latter symptom can require urgent ventilator support, according to the CDC. There is no specific treatment for AFM, but rather neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the AFM outbreak in 2014 coincided with an outbreak of enterovirus D68, the CDC did not detect traces of the severe respiratory virus in the AFM specimens collected that year. Among the people with AFM in 2015, the CDC also did not detect the virus in the specimens collected, and only limited sporadic cases of the virus have been detected in the United States in 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As health officials investigate the current rise of AFM cases, to prevent illness, they are advising people wash their hands with soap and water, avoid close contact with sick people, and clean surfaces with a disinfectant, especially those that a sick person has touched.

Doctors considered a list of diagnoses from Guillain-Barré Syndrome to various other auto-immune diseases.

Most patients were found to have distinctive abnormalities of the central spinal cord (i.e., gray matter) on magnetic resonance imaging, and most reported a respiratory or febrile illness preceding the onset of neurologic symptoms. On September 12, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment alerted CDC about this cluster. These cases coincided with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) (2). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On September 26, CDC issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing (3). A case was defined as acute onset of focal limb weakness occurring on or after August 1, 2014, and a magnetic resonance image showing a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to gray matter in a patient aged ≤21 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As of November 13, CDC had verified reports of 88 cases in 32 states (Figure). The median age of patients was 7.6 years (range = 5 months–20 years), and 54 (61%) were males. Limb weakness was asymmetrical in most patients. Cranial nerve motor dysfunction was reported in 30 (34%) cases. Six (7%) patients had altered mental status, and three (3%) had seizures. Most patients reported a respiratory illness (81%), a febrile illness (68%), or both, occurring before neurologic symptom onset; 8% had neither condition. Among 86 patients for whom past medical history was reported, 65 (76%) were previously healthy, and 21 (24%) had underlying illnesses, most commonly asthma (nine [10%]). All but one patient was hospitalized because of neurologic illness, and 17 (19%) required ventilator support. Among 80 patients from whom cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, 68 (85%) showed a moderate pleocytosis and normal or mildly elevated protein. Information regarding current clinical status was reported for 77 patients (median follow-up = 19 days). Of those, 49 (64%) reported some symptom improvement, and 28 (36%) showed no improvement; none were fully recovered. No deaths were reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among 71 patients with cerebrospinal fluid testing performed by their health care providers, state and local public health departments, or CDC, no enteroviruses or other pathogens have been confirmed to date. Among 41 patients whose upper respiratory tract samples were available for enterovirus/rhinovirus testing at CDC, 17 (41%) tested positive: eight (20%) for EV-D68 and nine (22%) for eight other enterovirus/rhinovirus types. Of the 19 patients whose upper respiratory tract samples were obtained <14 days from respiratory illness onset, 10 (53%) were positive: seven (37%) for EV-D68 and three (16%) for rhinoviruses. Laboratory testing for other pathogens is ongoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On November 7, CDC published interim clinical management considerations, summarizing expert opinion based on current evidence on management and care of children with acute flaccid myelitis (4). CDC continues to collaborate with partners nationally to investigate reported cases, risk factors, and possible etiologies of this condition. Although the specific causes of this illness are still under investigation, and causal relationship to EV-D68 has not yet been substantiated, being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent a number of severe diseases. Vaccine-preventable diseases include poliomyelitis, which is caused by poliovirus; infection with this enterovirus can present with acute flaccid paralysis. There are also numerous other vaccine-preventable diseases that can result in severe illness. Prevention of viral infections includes general hygienic measures, such as frequent hand washing with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick persons, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Additional information is available at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/habits/index.htm. If a child appears to have a sudden onset of weakness in arms or legs, caregivers should contact a health care provider to have the child assessed for possible neurologic illness. Health care providers are encouraged to report patients meeting the case definition to their state or local health department.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nA blood pattern analysis of the Shroud of Turin has revealed that there's just absolutely no way the stains could have been made by a body laying flat on the fabric. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A pair of researchers have found that the blood-like splotches on the linen cloth are inconsistent with each other - some can only have occurred by a person standing upright, while another is completely unrealistic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The famous length of fabric, which bears the image of a man, has long been thought to be the cloth that once wrapped the body of Christian figurehead Jesus of Nazareth. The imprint is said to have been transferred during the three days his body was interred. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientific analysis has not yet yielded an answer as to how the image was created on the fabric, but several reddish stains consistent with the reported crucifixion wounds of Jesus of Nazareth contain iron oxide - which could be from pigment, or could be from blood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, radiocarbon techniques have dated the shroud to between 1260 and 1390 CE. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The weave and the fabricweave and the fabric are both consistent with the Jesus of Nazareth time frame, as well as the Middle Ages; analysis of the cloth shows inconclusive evidence for pigment; and research determining a Middle Eastern provenance for pollen found on the cloth was later disavowed by one of its authors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Radiocarbon dating notwithstanding, it would be fascinating to know exactly how the shroud was made; and, if it's real, it could reveal new information about crucifixion techniques. Because evidence for the shroud's authenticity has been so inconclusive, there has been recent scientific interest in using forensic techniques to investigate it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is where forensic anthropologist Matteo Borrini of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and organic chemist Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences enter the picture. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rather than testing the substance itself, the researchers used a live subject and a mannequin to analyse the blood flow on wounds on the left hand, the forearms, the \"lance wound\" in the torso, and blood stains around the figure's waist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The technique is called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis; for this, they used two types of blood: human blood donated for the research, and synthetic blood with the same fluid properties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers studied the flow for different positions: on the back of the hand in contact with wood, to observe the pattern left on the hand; on the left forearm, with blood trickling from the hand, in a standing position, and again in a supine (lying on the back) position with the hand covering the groin, as seen on the shroud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They also investigated the short trickles on the back of the left hand; and the blood over the spear wound, as well as the lumbar region, thought to be blood flow from that wound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The wood test was inconclusive, but the blood flow tests show that the shroud is a mess. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For starters, the trickles on the back of the hand and the flow along the arm occurred at two completely different angles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trickles from the hand as seen on the shroud occurred in the tests with the arms at a 45 degree angle, but that just doesn't work for the supposed position of the body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The angle between the arm and the body must be greater than 80° and smaller than 100° in order for the rivulets to flow from the wrist toward the elbow on the outer part of the forearm, as it appears on the Shroud,\" the researchers wrote in their paper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Borrini & Garlaschelli/Journal of Forensic Science) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spear wound bled in a direction consistent with the Shroud image when the test subject was upright, as would occur if the victim were pierced while hanging crucified, but with one key difference: it formed rivulets, rather than a solidly filled stain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for the lower back stain, the scientists could not replicate it at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They attempted it with both bleeding from a supine position, as well as a test subject that had been standing and then laid on its back, and nothing managed to produce a \"blood belt\" in the lower back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Assuming that the red stains on the Turin linen are actually blood from the crucifixion wounds, the results of the experiments demonstrate that the alleged flowing patterns from different areas of the body are not consistent with each other. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Even supposing possible different episodes of bleeding (e.g., movements of the body, postmortem bleeding), these are not only non-documented, but also, as for the lumbar stains, they appear to be unrealistic,\" the researchers wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The inconsistencies identified by the authors seem not only to point against their own reality, but against the authenticity of the Shroud itself, suggesting that the Turin linen was an artistic or 'didactic' representation from the XIV century.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That doesn't mean the show is entirely over yet: until scientists are able to figure out exactly how the image was formed on the fabric, it's going to remain a tantalising scientific mystery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their findings have been published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences.\nPassage 2:\nThe Shroud of Turin, which has been revered by some Christians as the burial cloth of Jesus, could be a fake, according to a new forensic investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investigation into the bloodstain pattern on the cloth was reported Tuesday in the Journal of Forensic Sciences and is apparently the first such analysis of the controversial shroud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, the shroud shows the image of a crucified man and has been analyzed and scrutinized for many, many years. The Vatican regards it as an icon, rather than a religious relic—and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, more than 2 million people saw the Shroud of Turin, which is 14-feet-long, 3.5-feet-wide and kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case. The cloth has long been the subject of debate and study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers concluded that the linen seems to be patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse, reports BuzzFeed News, adding evidence to claims that it is a fraud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,” Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom, told BuzzFeed News. “Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borrini and his colleagues used real and synthetic blood samples to conduct seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric. By pumping blood onto a model at wound points shown on the shroud, researchers could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction depicted on the linen. They found bloodstains that were inconsistent with any single pose, which seems to suggest a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 11-MILLION-TON ICEBERG THREATENS TO INUNDATE TINY GREENLAND VILLAGE WITH TSUNAMI NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If it was truly the death shroud of someone hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, Borrini said, “the bloodstains shouldn’t be so inconsistent.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BuzzFeed reports that researchers found forearm rivulets matched an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, for example, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees. A simulated spear wound in the chest ran in completely different patterns than the one on the shroud, whether standing or prone. “This is just not what happens to a person on a cross,” Borrini said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Overall, the approach is founded in science and the methodology sound,” bloodstain pattern expert Jonathyn Priest of Bevel, Gardner and Associates Inc. told BuzzFeed News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Priest cautioned that the conclusions were based on body parts held in a fixed position, rather than accounting for carrying a body, cleaning a body, or preparing a body for burial, which might bear more study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The fact that flowing bloodstains exist at all on a deceased body that was reportedly cleaned also raises questions,” he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although this latest research is not definitive, generations of the faithful will continue to be fascinated by the Shroud of Turin.\nPassage 3:\n“This is just not what happens to a person on a cross,” said a forensic investigator. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gerard Julien / AFP / Getty Images Pope John Paul II prays at the Turin Cathedral of St. John the Baptist before the controversial Turin shroud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Shroud of Turin, long considered by some to be the burial cloth of Jesus, has inconsistent bloodstain patterns that suggest it is a fake, a new forensic investigation has found. Held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, the shroud bears an image of a crucified man. It has been analyzed for decades, to some controversy, with radiocarbon dating determining its origin to be between 1260 and 1390. It is regarded by the Vatican as an icon, rather than a genuine religious relic. More than 2 million people came to see the shroud during a three-month display in 2015, including Pope Francis. The bloodstain pattern investigation reported on Tuesday by the Journal of Forensic Sciences is the first such analysis of the cloth, looking at its purported blood splatters and their alignment to each other in a kind of crime scene analysis. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse, adding to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. “This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,” Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom, told BuzzFeed News. “Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borrini conducted the analysis with chemist Luigi Garlaschelli of the University of Pavia in Italy, using real and synthetic blood samples on cloth to test the orientation of stains on the better-defined left side of the cloth (they also compared the two liquids to see if they flowed the same way). They hoped to answer a debate over whether the crucifixion depicted on the cloth was T-shaped, Y-shaped, or some other manner of ancient Roman execution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead, they found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. If it were a death shroud of a bleeding, executed person, hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, Borrini said, “the bloodstains shouldn’t be so inconsistent.” In the analysis, the two researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric: the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back, along with a belt of blood (whether it is actually blood or paint pigments is another disputed forensic question) at the waist. By pumping blood onto a model at wound points depicted on the shroud, they could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction seen on the linen. They discovered the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part: The forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, for example, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees. A simulated spear wound in the chest ran in completely different patterns than the one on the shroud, whether standing or prone. “This is just not what happens to a person on a cross,” Borrini said.

Ultimately it was decided they could serve — with limitations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Art Iwasaki “They told us we couldn’t carry arms, and we were treated differently – just like a prisoner of war. That was very disappointing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR April Baer / OPB NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These young men were among the best the Northwest had to offer.

I got there in August. From there I got so bored I formed the Boy Scout troop. We were allowed to leave the compound for field trips. In December there were rumors we may be called to volunteer for the 442nd.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 442nd Regimental Combat Team was an all-Japanese-American regiment, it was formed mostly of young men whose families had been shipped to detainment camps because of their race. Still, these young men stepped forward in great numbers. The Army sought 2000 volunteers, but one historian estimates 10,000 Nisei answered the call. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kenji Yaguchi “I was one of the first to volunteer. Because I wanted to prove I was just a good as anybody else. No better, no worse.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Basic training was hard. Some men had to go through it twice, first with their integrated units, then again in segregated units after the 442nd was formed.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThis story appears in the December 12, 2017 issue of Forbes. Subscribe NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fresh off a tour through Thailand, Laos and China, United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr. picked up the phone on a Sunday afternoon in October to discuss something deeply personal: how much money he has. A year earlier, Forbes had listed his net worth at $2.9 billion on The Forbes 400, a number Ross claimed was far too low: He maintained he was closer to $3.7 billion. Now, after examining the financial-disclosure forms he filed after his nomination to President Donald Trump's Cabinet, which showed less than $700 million in assets, Forbes was intent on removing him entirely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross protested, citing trusts for his family that he said he did not have to disclose in federal filings. \"You're apparently not counting those, which are more than $2 billion,\" he said. When asked for documentation, the 79-year-old demurred, citing \"privacy issues.\" Told that Forbes nonetheless planned to remove him from the list for the first time in 13 years, he responded: \"As long as you explain that the reason is that assets were put into trust, I'm fine with that.\" And when did he make the transfer that allowed him to not disclose over $2 billion? \"Between the election and the nomination.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So began the mystery of Wilbur Ross' missing $2 billion. And after one month of digging, Forbes is confident it has found the answer: That money never existed. It seems clear that Ross lied to us, the latest in an apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications and whoppers that have been going on with Forbes since 2004. In addition to just padding his ego, Ross' machinations helped bolster his standing in a way that translated into business opportunities. And based on our interviews with ten former employees at Ross' private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., who all confirmed parts of the same story line, his penchant for misleading extended to colleagues and investors, resulting in millions of dollars in fines, tens of millions refunded to backers and numerous lawsuits. Additionally, according to six U.S. senators, Ross failed to initially mention 19 suits in response to a questionnaire during his confirmation process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nearly a week before this article went to press, both Ross and his team at the Commerce Department were sent a detailed list of questions. \"Secretary Ross has filed all required disclosures in accordance with the law and in consultation with both legal counsel and ethics officials at the Department of Commerce and Office of Government Ethics. As we have said before, any misunderstanding from your previous conversation with Secretary Ross is unfortunate.\" They declined to provide further answers on the record. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ross' questionable assertions to Forbes, combined with a recent controversy about a multimillion-dollar stake in a shipping company that does big business with close associates of Vladimir Putin, paint a clearer picture of the commerce secretary's tactics. His slippery statements during his confirmation hearings--\"I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt\"--came as no surprise to those who have known Ross for decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" says David Wax, who worked alongside Ross for 25 years and served as the No. 3 person in his firm. Another former colleague, who requested anonymity, was less circumspect: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Listen to Wilbur Ross apparently lie to Forbes: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twenty-six years before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, Wilbur Ross disappeared. It was 1990, corporate America was sick on junk bonds, and Ross was a top bankruptcy negotiator. But one November day, he failed to show up at an important meeting to brief bondholders in a furniture company's bankruptcy. They didn't know where he had gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until they went home and turned on the television. There was Ross, with Donald Trump, announcing a deal to recapitalize Trump's Taj Mahal casino, which was then careening toward bankruptcy. They were technically adversaries, with Ross representing one group of bondholders--at one point Trump asked them to fire Ross after he dismissed a Trump proposal to keep 100% of his equity, saying, \"It's too early for Christmas.\" But Ross eventually brokered a deal among Trump, debt holder Carl Icahn and Ross' own clients that allowed Trump to keep a 50% stake. \"I think [Ross] is very talented, a fantastic negotiator,\" Trump said at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The son of a judge, he always has been. He grew up in New Jersey, attended Yale and then Harvard Business School and eventually wound up as the bankruptcy work-out specialist at the investment bank Rothschild, where he was known for his ability to quickly distill complex situations. \"He was very, very sharp,\" says someone who worked with him back then. \"Very tough.\" By the early 1990s, his unit was bringing in around $18 million a year, with Ross personally pocketing more than a third of that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross was an extremely well-paid professional, but he yearned for the big money and big spotlight that come with having your own shop. \"People knew of him,\" says another former colleague, \"but not on his own.\" At first, he worked within Rothschild, raising $200 million for an internal private equity fund that would leverage his bankruptcy expertise to pick up companies on the cheap. Three years later, in 2000, he bought out the fund and slapped his name on the door. At 62, when most investment bankers start dabbling in golf and vineyards, Ross was poised to claim some glory for himself. Says Wax: \"He viewed it as an opportunity to have a pulpit, to name something after himself and to potentially make a lot of money.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross quickly accomplished all three of those things. In 2002, his firm invested in the bankrupt steelmaker LTV. According to a Harvard Business School case study, LTV had put $1.2 billion into new plants and equipment but laid off 7,500 union employees and faced a $3.4 billion pension burden. As a master of work-outs, Ross knew he could get the federal government to take over the pensions. According to people who worked at the firm then, Ross told the unions he'd buy the business if they let him hire back just 3,500 workers. Figuring 3,500 jobs were better than none, the union agreed, and WL Ross picked up most of LTV's assets, without the pension headaches, for $135 million and about $165 million in annual environmental liabilities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross' timing was impeccable. One week later, President George W. Bush issued a stiff tariff on steel imports, sending U.S. prices soaring and making Ross look like a genius. He rolled up several more steel companies, including Bethlehem Steel, into International Steel Group, which filed for an IPO in 2003. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross was technically the beneficial owner of nearly $1 billion worth of the stock. But most of that belonged to his investors, not Ross personally. In 2005, Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal bought the business for around $4.5 billion in cash and stock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross personally invested only about $3 million in his firm's first two funds, according to former employees. Buoyed by International Steel Group, he roughly tripled that money, but the bigger payout came from carried interest--the manager's cut of overall profits, typically 20%. In all, Ross made an estimated $260 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A huge score, yes, though not nearly enough to be one of the 400 richest people in America. But when a Forbes reporter reached out to Ross, apparently crediting him with his investors' money, the future commerce secretary did nothing to clarify the situation, according to notes at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I just spoke to Ross,\" the reporter wrote. \"He's one of the easiest new guys I've put on [The Forbes 400] in a while. Very low-key, said he didn't really want to be on, but at the same time wasn't going to fight success. He says he doesn't want to juice up his numbers at all.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I told him we're going to start him at $1 billion,\" added the reporter, who no longer works at Forbes . \"And he said 'Yep, fine, thank you.' \" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross appeared on The Forbes 400 for the first time in 2004, with a net worth listed at $1 billion. It was nearly four times as much as he was likely worth. \"Everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" says a former colleague of Ross. A legend was born, and like most legends, this one had its roots in a myth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within days of that fateful issue of Forbes, Ross married for the third time at a beachside church in Southampton, New York. His bride, Hilary, 12 years younger, had spent much of her life in the Hamptons and Palm Beach, two of the East Coast's most famous billionaire playgrounds. \"She brought him a certain kind of prominence, socially,\" says David Patrick Columbia, who publishes Hilary's musings on his website, New York Social Diary. \"It was a perfect merger.\" Adds another contemporary: \"She wants her husband to be on The Forbes 400.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Life began to change for Ross. Once known for quirky suspenders, he now wore impeccable suits. A workaholic for most of his career, he began spending much of the year outside of New York. He started flying private, built up a collection of paintings by the Belgian artist René Magritte and bought a Palm Beach estate for $13 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His fundraising kept pace with his spending. In 2005, he raised a $1.1 billion flagship fund, his largest yet. The next year, he sold WL Ross & Co. to the publicly traded investment-management company Invesco for $100 million up front and the ability to earn an additional $275 million, depending on how much money he was able to raise in later funds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Invesco and a big incentive behind him, Ross raised a massive $4.1 billion fund in 2007, putting roughly $70 million of his own money into that one and the 2005 predecessor, according to three former employees. His net worth at this time was likely around $400 million, thanks to the sale of WL Ross & Co. But when contacted by Forbes that year, he gave valuations for his firm's investments as if the money belonged to him. The myth, with Forbes compounding it based on our original mistake and Ross' exhortations, got bigger. Now Forbes listed Ross with a net worth of $1.7 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That wasn't enough. \"I would say the total now is a bit more than $2 billion,\" Ross wrote in a 2011 email, according to notes taken at the time. In 2013, a different Forbes reporter realized that prior estimates seemed to include not just Ross' money but that of the investors in his funds. Ross strung us along, leading us to believe he would provide evidence of his assets, but never did. Just months later, he was insisting that he was even richer, and Forbes continued to largely fall for it. \"2.75 [billion] is a bit low but probably close enough,\" he wrote in an email around the start of 2014. In September, he was arguing for a valuation of $3.45 billion but begrudgingly accepted a smaller figure: \"3.1 [billion] is low, but I understand why you wish to be conservative.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Why wouldn't Ross be satisfied with $400 million? \"You're talking about someone as egotistical as they come,\" Wax says. Five other former employees add a more tangible reason: The more money Ross appeared to be worth, the more money investors seemed willing to give him. \"Really, for us, it was a bet on him, \" says Sam Green, who helped put $300 million into Ross' funds on behalf of the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, citing his personal wealth as one factor. \"I don't know of any better indicator of future success than having been successful in the past.\" Ross had seemed to figure out how to make fake numbers generate real assets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2010, Ross set out to raise a new private equity fund, hoping to come up with another $4 billion. It was an audacious goal in the wake of the financial crisis, far more than many of his partners thought would be possible. After two years of fundraising, Ross closed it with just $640 million of investments. Still, he told the media he had raised $2.2 billion. Technically true but also misleading. Most of the other $1.6 billion or so came from other funds or accounts that paid little or no fee to Invesco. Given that shareholders might assume that the firm had an extra $2.2 billion of assets generating fees for its private equity arm, which was not true, Invesco later clarified the matter on an earnings call. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were also charges related to transparency inside the funds. In August 2016, the SEC announced a settlement with Invesco-owned WL Ross after investigating whether the firm had charged its investors improper fees from 2001 to 2011. WL Ross agreed to pay a $2.3 million fine, without admitting or denying the findings of the investigation. It also agreed to refund $11.8 million to investors. And that was small potatoes: Buried in its 2015 annual report, Invesco disclosed that it had paid an additional $43 million in reimbursements and regulatory expenses associated with its private equity business in the previous two years. The filings don't explicitly connect that money to WL Ross--and these payments have never before been reported--but four former employees said they were all tied to Wilbur Ross' firm. Invesco declined to comment for this story. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2012, Ross' longtime No. 2, David Storper, left the firm but said he retained interests in many of the funds. Three years later, Storper alleged in a lawsuit that the firm sent him inaccurate financial information after his departure and that Wilbur Ross stole his interests outright. Ross denied the allegations, and the lawsuit remains ongoing. A few years earlier, a vice chairman of WL Ross sued Wilbur Ross for more than $20 million, alleging that Ross tried to cut him out of interest and fees he had been promised. The parties had reached a settlement by 2007, which former employees say cost about $10 million. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Storper case has other ex-employees looking back to be sure they were sent proper information. Joseph Mullin, a former member of WL Ross' 15-person investment team, filed his own suit against WL Ross & Co., also alleging that Ross took his interests after he left. The firm filed a motion to dismiss in February, but the case remains active. A third ex-colleague, who is not in litigation, argues that Ross' tactics went beyond hard-nosed negotiating: \"Everybody does some cheating, everybody does some lying. Not everybody steals from their employees.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On November 8, 2016, the night that upended American politics, Wilbur Ross was with Donald Trump, his family and top backers in New York City. The relationships inside this inner sanctum ran deep. Billionaire Phillip Ruffin, the president's Las Vegas partner who had Trump serve as best man at his wedding, was there. So was Icahn and apparently Richard LeFrak, the real estate tycoon who was part of the Palm Beach circle that included Trump and Ross. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ross was the only one who left his day job to join Trump in government. \"I'd rather hang myself,\" Ruffin told Forbes earlier this year. \"I don't know why Wilbur took it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But viewed in the context of Ross' career arc, it makes perfect sense. The steel deal made him rich, but his returns have been mediocre since, so much so that WL Ross filed documents to raise a sixth flagship fund last year, but nothing seemed to come of it. Trump, the guy he kept afloat 26 years before, offered his fellow attention-seeking dealmaker a lifeline to relevance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ross' appointment as secretary of commerce came with one catch: He had to disclose his assets, providing evidence that he was not as rich as he had long claimed. In 2015, he sent Forbes a detailed breakdown of his supposed holdings, listing $1.25 billion in partnership interests, $1.1 billion in municipal bonds, $500 million in equities, $200 million in art, $110 million in real estate and $200 million in cash, for a fanciful total of $3.4 billion, according to notes taken at the time. We eventually listed him at $2.9 billion. Last year, Ross' assistant claimed $3.7 billion; we stuck with $2.9 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His former colleagues saw the moment of reckoning coming as soon as he accepted a Cabinet role. \"It was surprising because he would have to reveal to the world that he wasn't a billionaire,\" one ex-employee said. \"I was surprised that he would take that risk.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ross was ready to double down, even while he was a Cabinet member, telling Forbes about the putative $2 billion asset transfer to his family members after the election. That opened up a storm of questions from ethics and tax experts. If Ross had owned $2 billion of additional assets before the election, wouldn't they have produced income that he was required to disclose, even if he no longer owned the assets? And why would someone apparently transfer $2 billion to his family, thereby triggering more than $800 million in gift taxes, especially with a president in the White House who was prepared to eliminate the estate tax and therefore much of the cost of transferring fortunes to later generations? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I am aware of the ethics and tax rules and have complied with all of them,\" Ross wrote in an October email to Forbes . \"Aren't you going a bit overboard on this? I have explained my situation to you and am surprised and disappointed by the seemingly accusatory tone of your email. For more than 50 years I have had a good relationship with your publication and with the Forbes family. And never have had a bad experience with either. In fact I was just the featured speaker at your magazine's hundredth anniversary CEO conference in Hong Kong.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Forbes published an online story on October 16 laying out those questions, six Senate Democrats wrote a letter to the top ethics official in the federal government, asking him to figure out what was going on with Ross' finances. \"It is imperative that Congress and the Office of Government Ethics know the full extent of Mr. Ross's holdings to ensure he is not putting personal gain ahead of the interests of the American people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Department of Commerce issued a statement saying the $2 billion gift never happened. \"Contrary to the report in Forbes, there was no major asset transfer to a trust in the period between the election and Secretary Ross's confirmation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only problem with that statement: The person who told Forbes that the transfer had taken place, that it had happened after the election and that it had meant more than $2 billion of family assets weren't on the disclosure was none other than the sitting secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross.\nPassage 2:\nDefending his appointment of a billionaire to promote the country’s economic growth, Donald Trump has said that he does not want poor people to hold economic roles in his administration.

In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved “a spectrum of behaviour”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damon said there was “a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added that society was in a “watershed moment” and said it was “wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it’s totally necessary”. But he said: “We live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we’re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, ‘Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her first response to Damon, Driver wrote on Twitter: “God God, seriously? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Gosh it’s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women’s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver’s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: “There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it’s still cancer.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: “I felt I desperately needed to say something. I’ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it’s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver’s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That’s the sign of somebody who – well, we can work with that,” Damon said, adding: “I don’t know Louis CK. I’ve never met him. I’m a fan of his, but I don’t imagine he’s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he’s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... ” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,” she said. “It seems to me that he thinks that because he didn’t rape somebody – so far as we know – that what he did do wasn’t as bad.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women. In response, he said “these stories are true” but did not specifically apologise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Damon attends a screening in New York. Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That’s a problem,” Driver continued. “If good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we’re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,” she said. “Put abuse in there … that all abuse is equal but some is worse.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She added: “There is no hierarchy of abuse – that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn’t want or ask for … you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “And it certainly can’t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency.

Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There is not a woman I know,” Driver said, “myself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn’t sleep with.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Driver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,” she said, “I feel that’s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Men can rally and they can support, but I don’t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse. Ever.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR\nPassage 3:\nMatt Damon addressed the sexual allegations against Harvey Weinstein, saying, “I knew I wouldn’t want him married to anyone close to me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interested in Harvey Weinstein?

Add Interest NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But that was the extent of what we knew. I mean, and that wasn’t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that — I mean, look at the guy. Of course he’s a womanizer,” Damon continued in an interview for ABC News’ “Popcorn With Peter Travers.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damon, who stars in the upcoming film “Downsizing,” worked with Weinstein on his Oscar-winning film “Good Will Hunting,” which was produced by Weinstein’s production company Miramax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past year, several women have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Weinstein has acknowledged inappropriate behavior but has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances,” his spokesman previously said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a wide-ranging discussion with Travers on Tuesday, Damon opened up about Weinstein and others inside and outside the entertainment world who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read part of Damon’s conversation with Travers below. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maryellen McGrath/ABC NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Travers: We live now in a different age, in a political age. There’s a lot of dissidence that goes on in the world that could affect you as an actor. We’re also in the age of people charged with sexual misconduct. This is everywhere. How do you react to that? Especially you, as the father of four girls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Matt Damon: I think we’re in this watershed moment. I think it’s great. I think it’s wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories, and it’s totally necessary … I do believe that there’s a spectrum of behavior, right? And we’re going to have to figure — you know, there’s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated, right? You know, we see somebody like Al Franken, right? — I personally would have preferred if they had an Ethics Committee investigation, you know what I mean? It’s like at what point — you know, we’re so energized to kind of get retribution, I think. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And we live in this culture of outrage and injury, and, you know, that we’re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, “Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.” You know what I mean? … The Louis C.K. thing, I don’t know all the details. I don’t do deep dives on this, but I did see his statement, which kind of, which [was] arresting to me. When he came out and said, “I did this. I did these things. These women are all telling the truth.” And I just remember thinking, “Well, that’s the sign of somebody who — well, we can work with that” … Like, when I’m raising my kids, this constant personal responsibility is as important as anything else they learn before they go off in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the fear for me is that right now, we’re in this moment where at the moment — and I hope it doesn’t stay this way — the clearer signal to men and to younger people is, deny it. Because if you take responsibility for what you did, your life’s going to get ruined … NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I mean, look, as I said, all of that behavior needs to be confronted, but there is a continuum. And on this end of the continuum where you have rape and child molestation or whatever, you know, that’s prison. Right? And that’s what needs to happen. OK? And then we can talk about rehabilitation and everything else. That’s criminal behavior, and it needs to be dealt with that way. The other stuff is just kind of shameful and gross, and I just think … I don’t know Louis C.K.. I’ve never met him. I’m a fan of his, but I don’t imagine he’s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he’s paid at this point is so beyond anything that he — I just think that we have to kind of start delineating between what these behaviors are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: It’s harder, isn’t it, though, when you actually know someone who gets accused? We both know Harvey Weinstein. I’ve worked with him. But I didn’t see any of this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: When you see Al Franken taking a picture putting his hands on that woman’s flak jacket and mugging for the camera, going like that, you know, that is just like a terrible joke, and it’s not funny. It’s wrong, and he shouldn’t have done that … But when you talk about Harvey and what he’s accused of, there are no pictures of that. He knew he was up to no good. There’s no witnesses. There’s no pictures. There’s no braggadocio … So they don’t belong in the same category. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: I think it becomes for all of us, too, that are in any way around it, even though we’re not seeing it, is, what’s our responsibility to make sure it doesn’t happen? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: A lot of people said, ‘Well, Harvey — everybody knew.’ As you were saying, that’s not true. Everybody knew what kind of guy he was in the sense that if you took a meeting with him, you knew that he was tough and he was a bully, and that was his reputation. And he enjoyed that reputation, because he was making the best movies out there … NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [With regard to the rape allegations,] nobody who made movies for him knew … Any human being would have put a stop to that, no matter who he was. They would’ve said absolutely no. You know what I mean? … I knew I wouldn’t want him married to anyone close to me. But that was the extent of what we knew, you know? And that wasn’t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that — I mean, look at the guy. Of course he’s a womanizer … I mean, I don’t hang out with him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: But you can’t live his life for him. Or be responsible for his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: Right. So the question is, at what point does somebody’s behavior that you have a professional relationship with … away from the profession bother enough that you don’t want to work with them? For me, I’ve always kind of, you know, as long as nobody’s committing a crime — well, that’s your life, and you go live it. I don’t need to be spending time with you, away from my professional life, at least. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maryellen McGrath/ABC NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: [We’ve seen] Ridley Scott, who directed you in “The Martian,” having to erase Kevin Spacey from “All the Money in the World” and having to replace him with Christopher Plummer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: That was smart. That was a total business decision by Ridley. I haven’t talked to him, but … it wasn’t a creative choice for Ridley. Ridley has a big movie coming out … and nobody right now is in the mood to see a Kevin Spacey movie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And I think he’s right about that. He’s one of the few directors who could just turn on a dime and shoot for a week a month before a movie comes out and, you know, expunge an actor. And I don’t disagree with his decision to do that. I mean, that movie, I think, will do much better without Kevin in it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Editor’s note: In response to the allegations against him made by Anthony Rapp, Kevin Spacey released a statement on Oct. 29, saying, in part, “I’m beyond horrified to hear his story. I honestly do not remember the encounter … But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.” In November a spokesperson for Spacey said he was “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.”] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: When it’s in that gray area and it’s friends of yours or people that you do know, do you try to talk to them afterwards and say, “What’s going on? Can I help?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: It depends on what the accusation is. It depends what’s going on. If it’s a friend of mine, I’m always talking to them. I know the real story if it’s my friend. If it’s a colleague … I don’t know … I guess it depends on the situation and the allegation and how believable I think it is. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: We’re going to see the change in the making of movies now with people being so aware. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: I also think the day of the confidentiality agreements is over. I think it’s just completely over. Ten years ago, you made a claim against me and I had a big movie coming out, OK? I have $100 million or I have a movie that is personally important to me coming out, and close to the release of that film, you say, “Matt Damon grabbed my butt and stuck his tongue down my throat.” We would then go to mediation and organize a settlement. I’d go, “I don’t want this out there. Peter’s going to go out and talk to the press and run his mouth, and it’s going to be overshadowing the opening of this movie. How much money do you want?” The lawyers would get together, and they do this cost-benefit analysis, and they’d go, “Oh, this is what it’s worth.” And I look at the number and go, “OK, I’ll pay it, but you can never talk about this again. You’re f------ lying about this, but never talk about this again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now … with social media, these stories get — it’s like they get gasoline poured on them. So the moment a claim is made, if you make that same claim today to me, I would be scorched earth. I’d go, “I don’t care if it costs $10 million to fight this in court with you for 10 years, you are not taking my name from me. You are not taking my name and my reputation from me. I’ve worked too hard for it. And I earned it. You can’t just blow me up like that.” So I think once a claim is made, there will no longer be settlements. That’s just my prediction, I mean, just based on what I’ve seen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: Isn’t that a good thing? Women have been doing it, and they’ve been told they can’t express what happened to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: One hundred percent … I think that it’s important, especially in that, you know, we believe every woman who’s coming forward with one of these stories needs to be listened to and heard. I think one of the surprising things for me has been the extent to which my female friends, as, I think, of all the ones I’ve talked to in the last year since all this stuff started happening — I can’t think of any of them who don’t have a story at some point in their life. And most of them have more than one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: I don’t know how old your daughters are, but how do you deal with them living in this world where even they, whatever ages they are, can’t escape this in the headlines? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: You just have to raise children with, like, self-esteem, because you’re not going to be there to make all of their decisions for them. And you have to just hope that they have enough self-respect to make the best decisions they can. I mean, the Harvey situation is particularly horrible, because, you know, those women — when you say, “Hey, let’s take a meeting in a hotel room.” I mean, we auditioned, you know, for “Good Will Hunting” in a hotel room. Like, it’s common to take meetings in a hotel room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And this is the most powerful man in the movie business at the time, like in the ’90s, like Harvey was. That was the place to be. And if you get a thing from your agent on the letterhead of your agency that says, “Go meet Harvey Weinstein, the rainmaker, the guy that makes these great movies, at the Peninsula Hotel,” you’re going to that meeting … You don’t go into that meeting thinking something bad is going to happen to you … I don’t know who’s taking meetings in hotel rooms now. I mean, sometimes you’re in a different city and you just don’t have anywhere to meet. But, so no matter how smart my daughters are, no matter how prepared they are, there’s still those situations that that’s the nightmare kind of scenario. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Play NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PT: Do you worry about your daughters less because of the change in the industry? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MD: With social media, you know, and a Twitter account, you have the same platform as The New York Times now, so there aren’t secrets. It’s harder to do this type of thing. I would like to point out, though, that even though it feels like there’s this avalanche of men … Well here’s my optimistic spin, this is like 1 percent of the guys who are losing their careers. It’s not everybody. It just feels like it. There’s so many great men and women in the movie business. So many great people. It’s such a wonderful collection of people overall. And these rotten horrible apples are getting weeded out right now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that’s fine. That’s a good thing. That’s progress. But again, when we go back to talking about our own growth and development as human beings. We have to get to a place where we’re looking at one end of the spectrum and saying, “Well, let’s deal with this with some reflection and dialogue and some reconciliation, and let’s all grow together and move on.” And then I’ll think we’ll be making progress.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nAfter calling it Project Natal for more than a year, Microsoft finally gives its motion-control system a real name, formally unveiling Kinect during a special Cirque du Soleil performance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An official product shot of Kinect, formally known as Project Natal, the new motion-control system from Microsoft. The company showed it off Sunday night in a special performance in Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LOS ANGELES--After more than a year of speculation, we finally know what Microsoft's new motion-control system is called. For those that have referred to it for a year as Project Natal, meet Kinect for Xbox 360. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Sunday night, at the University of Southern California's Galen Center here, and during a special performance by Cirque du Soleil, Microsoft finally and formally pulled back the wraps on its much-anticipated system, now known as Kinect, but originally the work of the Israeli company 3DV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After sitting through (actually standing, as the press was placed on the floor of the arena for a couple of hours with no seats) the performance, in which the Cirque's performers acted out and demonstrated a number of ways that Kinect can be used, my first impression is that Microsoft has hit on something with some serious potential. But at least as demonstrated Sunday, that potential hasn't been fully realized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was tempting to think that Microsoft was taking Kinect a little too seriously during the performance, given the scale and scope of the event (more on that in a bit), but it's clear that the company has a system on its hands that it plans to incorporate widely across its video gaming and digital living room environments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And while it's too soon to tell exactly how Kinect will be used, and what software is being developed for it--Microsoft will say a lot more Monday morning at its formal E3 press conference--one thing became clear Sunday night: with Kinect, and a sports game, and an exercise game for it, Microsoft is, among other things, putting Nintendo and its Wii, its Balance Board, its Wii Fit and Wii Sports squarely in its sights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clever entrance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After waiting in line for more than an hour, the thousands of people on hand for the Sunday night event were ushered inside the Galen Center. While we didn't know what was in store, we were first taken through mock living rooms, where \"normal\" American families greeted us. We didn't get to sit down, however, but were clearly being led to see how Kinect, nee Project Natal, is an integral part of the living room experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Everyone was then given a white poncho, with large shoulder pads, and awhile into the Cirque's performance, I looked around the arena and had a definite sense of being part of some sort of religious revival, what with thousands of people sitting and standing together, all wearing identical shimmering white ponchos. No individuality here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the performance finally began, a loud, all-encompassing voice boomed out of speakers and began spelling out homilies, among them that history was about to be rewritten and that for the first time, human beings would be in control and that the machines are going to have to adapt to us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"After 5 million years of evolution,\" the voice boomed, \"might the next step be the absence of an object?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR High on the walls of the arena were large digital screens, and these became the place where we were able to really see what Kinect is all about. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Far up one wall, a \"real\" living room was placed, and there, a \"family\" of mom and dad, brother and sister took turns playing all kinds of games and other experiences for Kinect. While not naming any of these games, it was clear that Microsoft was previewing what it would be showing off tomorrow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, a giant, glowing Xbox symbol rose out of the stage where the Cirque du Soleil performers were doing their thing. And on top of this stood one of the kids, who raised his arms and began to show how Kinect would mirror his movements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The kid yelled out, \"What's your name?\" And the disembodied system responded, with letters jumbled on a screen and then placed in order, \"Kinect.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Credit: Microsoft) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few minutes later, we saw how by walking in front of a Kinect system, your body movement is matched by that of an avatar on the screen. Then we saw how you can wave your arms to flip the pages of a large \"book, \"which in this case was used to embed photos Kinect was taking of the family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Game time NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And now it was time to play some games. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Standing in front of the Kinect system, the young boy began miming out the movements for a river rafting game, and high on the walls, on digital representations of giant TVs, we saw his avatar riding a raft, dipping and weaving his way down a river of rapids. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soon, the raft morphed into a platform of sorts riding on rails and here, we saw one of the directions Microsoft and its developer partners are clearly going with Kinect: to score points, the kid had to wave his arms around in order to get his avatar to do the same and accurately hit a series of targets coming at him on different parts of the screen. If a target was high and to his left, that's where he had to put his arms. Low and right? He had to put his arms there. And so on. This looked pretty cool, and was definitely one of the things that showed the device's potential. It made me feel a little bit like it was Disneyland's Jungle Cruise on crack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next up was a driving game, and not surprisingly, controlling the vehicle by miming a steering wheel with your hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The game itself looked kind of cool, and at one point, as the car vaulted high into the air on the screen, it slowed down and took on freedom of movement in 360 degrees, and was able to totally change direction and aim at a different set of targets. And then it became a flying car, with wings, which was being controlled by both the \"brother\" and the \"sister,\" each standing on one of the \"wings.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then it was time for a \"Star Wars\" scene, and the avatar belonging to \"dad\" suddenly had a light saber in his hands, and \"dad\" was able to control it with nothing but his hands. First he was fending off Stormtroopers, and then, of course, it was time to battle Darth Vader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was all well and good for the kids and for men, but what about women? Well, then it was time for a yoga scene, and sure enough, Microsoft showed how Kinect can be used for a stylish yoga regimen, with the user's avatar almost exactly mirroring her body motions. How exactly that will work in consumer software is not entirely clear to me, but I'm sure we'll see on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By now I was seeing some of the strategy, and understanding how Microsoft seemed to be showing glimpses of its versions of the games and hardware that helped Nintendo's Wii become such a hit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The yoga demonstration and the flying car, for example, seemed to be aimed at Nintendo's Balance Board. And then we saw a big multi-sports competition game, in which the family faced off in sports like Hurdles (jumping), javelin (throwing), bowling, beach volleyball, soccer and the 100-meter sprint. This was Wii Sports writ for Kinect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was also a dancing game, in which the performers showed how it was necessary to mimic an on-screen avatar's moves precisely in order to get points--turning most of what we'd seen so far on its head, of course, in that the humans were now following the avatar, rather than the reverse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then, it was over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obviously, Sunday night's event wasn't meant to unveil specifics about the kinds of games that will be available when Kinect ships, likely this fall. That will come Monday, with Microsoft's press conference. Nor did Microsoft talk pricing Sunday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But what it did was issue a clear challenge, both to Nintendo and its hugely popular Wii system, and to Sony, which is also working on its own motion control system, known until now as Move. Sony will likely be showing a lot more about Move--including perhaps another brand name--with its own press conference on Tuesday. And Nintendo, too, will be showing off its goods on Tuesday. So one has to wonder how it and Sony will answer Microsoft's challenge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR My takeaway from Sunday night, as I alluded to above, is that Microsoft definitely thinks it has a game-changer with Kinect. And I surely see the potential. I hope that it will be showing a lot more on Monday, because with what we saw Sunday night, I'm impressed, but not all that much so. It was the sign of a nice addition to the motion controller wars, but not yet anything that completely upends things. And mainly that's because nothing Microsoft showed Sunday night was all that much of a surprise. We've known about Project Natal for more than a year. This all seemed like obvious directions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That might change on Monday, but unless it does, I'd have to say that Microsoft is going to have to work very hard in the coming months to live up to how seriously it is taking itself with Kinect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On June 24, CNET News reporter Daniel Terdiman and his Geek Gestalt blog will kick off Road Trip 2010. After driving more than 18,000 miles in the Rocky Mountains, the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest and the Southeast over the last four years, I'll be looking for the best in technology, science, military, nature, aviation and more throughout the American northeast. If you have a suggestion for someplace to visit, drop me a line. In the meantime, you can follow my preparations for the project on Twitter @GreeterDan and @RoadTrip.\nPassage 2:\nMaybe it was the Cirque du Soleil acrobats dancing to taiko drums, the 9-foot tall elephant puppet or the ponchos with illuminating shoulder pads for audience members, but Microsoft’s much-anticipated Project Natal preview was a cross between a gospel revival and a Las Vegas show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microsoft NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the event was short on news, Microsoft did unveil a new name — Kinect — for Project Natal, the motion technology that lets users play videogames and interact with the Xbox 360 console with gestures and spoken commands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Sunday night event, which kicked off the E3 Expo videogame industry tradeshow, was meant to be a way for audience members to get a sneak peek at Kinect. The details about pricing and availability are expected to be unveiled at its Monday press conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kinect is seen as Microsoft’s answer to Nintendo Co.’s Wii, which popularized game play. However, unlike the Wii, Kinect doesn’t require a controller at all and, according to Microsoft, it can recognize a wider range of motion and even differentiate voices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Audience members were handed white silk ponchos with shoulder pads upon entering the University of Southern California basketball arena. In order to reach the event, certain audience members were told to walk into one of many fake living rooms where a family greeted them and pointed the way to the main stage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once there, hundreds of audience members, all wearing the white silky robes, milled about the floor of the arena until the show started. In one corner, a family sat on a sofa suspended about 50 feet in the air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Declaring that “history is about to be rewritten,” the show started off with Cirque acrobats, dressed prehistorically, forming a procession with Japanese taiko drums beating in the background. Then a boy rode in on what appeared to be a mechanical elephant with a screen on the side. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once he reached the stage, the boy demonstrated the evolution from playing games with a controller to playing games with motion as the audience oohed and aahed. The final step revealed the boy standing on a giant black ball with a neon-green “X,” the Xbox logo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rest of the show was a parade of games, which the boy and “his family” demonstrated in a model living room, which occasionally rotated 360 degrees. There were also moments where the family would be playing with Kinect while what appeared to be a young girl walked upside down on the ceiling above them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the games previewed by Microsoft was whitewater rafting and a racing game, as well as virtual Tai Chi and a preview of a Star Wars game that lets players fight Darth Vader with a light saber. There was also a collection of sports games that lets players jump hurdles, run sprints, play volleyball, kick a soccer ball and bowl. Another let you train and play with a virtual tiger cub. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show ended with a grand finale demo of many different families playing dancing games where they learn various steps and moves with the help of a virtual instructor.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Unabomber thought so highly of his environmental manifesto that he threatened to keep killing if the New York Times and Washington Post didn't publish it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But 15 years after he was arrested at his remote cabin outside Lincoln, Mont., his twisted words seem to be worth less than his ratty sweatshirt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Marshall's office is currently holding an online auction of the personal effects of Ted Kaczynski, who, between 1978 and 1995, engaged in a mail bombing spree, killing three people and injuring 23 others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 68-year-old terrorist is currently serving a life sentence at a federal prison in Florence, Colo. The auction of his belongings ends June 2 and all the money raised will be used to pay off a $15 million restitution order to his victims and their families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since Kaczynski's actions were designed to protest modern society's \"industrial-technological system,\" there aren't nearly enough possessions on the auction block to raise $15 million, especially because his most valuable possession -- the cabin he built in the Montana wilderness -- is now on display in the Washington, D.C. Newseum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, at least two items are getting some serious bids: His 35,000 word handwritten manifesto currently has a bid of $17,525, while the iconic hoodie made famous by the artistic rendering in the FBI's \"Wanted\" poster is up to $20,025 -- though for that price, the successful bidder will also receive a pair of sunglasses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another item attracting interest is Kaczynski's Smith-Corona typewriter. Bids for that are currently around the $11,000 mark. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story continues below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other items have attracted less attention. The top bid for a hand-bowed wood saw that Kaczynski used is currently only $310, while handwritten letters to his Aunt Frida are only getting bids around $250. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, some people might say it's a sad sign of the times that the auction is even taking place, and you won't get an argument from art historian and appraiser Elyse Luray, who is best known for her work on the PBS series \"History Detectives.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But she still believes there is value to be found in the auction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I hate to say it, but there is some collectibility in this auction,\" Luray told AOL Weird News. \"This is one of the most tragic events in U.S. history and the manifesto has historical value as does the typewriter that he used to type his two manifestos. You have to take the emotion out of it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Luray dismisses most of what is being sold, figuring it is only going to be of value to \"some weird who wants something belonging to the Unabomber.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, she can see why something as mundane as Kaczynski's hand saw might be selling for much more than its actually worth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Hype increases value,\" she said. \"On the other hand, things like Marilyn Monroe's dresses or Liz Taylor's jewelry will retain value over the years.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, crime memorabilia collectors like Scott Michaels think there is a lot of value in being able to tell friends and neighbors that the saw they are borrowing was once used by the Unabomber. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michaels is the proprietor of Dearly Departed Tours, a company that shows crime aficionados visiting Los Angeles all the city's most infamous crime-oriented sights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Michaels is also a collector who has in his possession some extraordinary pieces of macabre memorabilia, including a piece of John Denver's plane, a hunk of the Hindenberg, and a tile from the swimming pool where Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones drowned. He also owns a clown painting made by serial killer John Wayne Gacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michaels makes no bones about his hobby (unless, of course, he chooses to buy one for his collection), but admits he often has to defend it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is history I choose to embrace,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I don't understand why people collect coins. You know, this is more common than people want to admit. Take a look at Dealey Plaza in Dallas. The people that are going there are basically there to see where JFK was shot.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From an objective viewpoint, he can see the value in the Unabomber's hoodie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That hoodie is iconic,\" he said. \"It really is the 'tah-dah' item, but the documents are interesting too.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet if he were to bid on an item himself, Michaels knows which one he'd choose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'd gravitate towards the saw,\" Michaels said. \"I like the human touch, knowing that he probably used it. I remember when they were doing a Marilyn Monroe auction. I never could have afforded the dresses, but I did purchase some golf course pencils that were stuck in her junk drawer.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sadly, Michaels doesn't have the room in his house to hold his entire collection. Much of it is in storage, where it will remain until he is able to open an office-slash-museum large enough for his creepy collectibles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although the market for crime memorabilia might seem to be new, criminologist Jeffery Ian Ross Ph.D. says it's been going on for a few hundred years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Ever since the invention of the printing press, the public hase been fascinated by crime,\" Ross said. \"I think the reason that the memorabilia has a certain appeal is partially motivated by boredom and voyeurism and a desire to have a connection with what's going on in the news.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the way, if you're thinking of jumping in on the auction at the last minute hoping to get rich off the Unabomber's memorabilia, Michaels has one word of advice: Don't! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I couldn't imagine buying any of this in order to make money,\" he said. \"This is more about having something that you find interesting to own. It's kind of fun to say, 'Hey, Jeffrey Dahmer used to own that video cassette of 'Exorcist III.'\"\nPassage 2:\nBehind all the muscle and good looks that make up Twilight beefcake Kellan Lutz, there’s a mushy charitable soul who’s doing his part along with a bunch of fellow celebs by auctioning off some luggage for a good cause.

Anthony Rapp, an actor on Star Trek: Discovery, told BuzzFeed in an interview on Oct. 29 that Spacey made sexual advances in 1986, when he was 14, in Spacey's New York apartment. Spacey issued a statement saying he was \"beyond horrified\" to hear the accusation, insisting he didn't remember the encounter but apologizing to Rapp. In the same statement, he came out as gay for the first time in public, infuriating gay rights advocates who viewed his acknowledgment as a false conflation of homosexuality with pedophilia in an attempt to distract attention from the underlying accusation.

Justin Dawes told BuzzFeed on Nov. 3 he was 16 and a theater usher in New Haven, Conn., in 1988, when Spacey, then appearing in a play there, invited him and a male friend to his apartment to watch a movie. Instead, Dawes said, Spacey gave them cocktails and played pornography on the TV. Dawes said it was \"awkward\" but not intimidating, and they left without incident. Still, “He knew that I was in high school. It was pretty clear. It's not like I was pretending to be an older, cooler person.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5. Mark Ebenhoch was a 35-year-old military advisor working in uniform on the set of 1995's Outbreak when, he said, Spacey (who had a role in the movie) instructed one of his \"harem\" of young male crewmembers to solicit him for sex with Spacey, BuzzFeed reported on Nov. 3. Ebenhoch turned him down feigning disgust because he was then in the closet himself and feared repercussions for his career. “As a military adviser the last thing you’d want anyone to know is that you were gay,” he told BuzzFeed.

The assistant said the touching was non-consensual. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 12. Anonymous British journalist: BuzzFeed reported on Nov. 3 that a British journalist then in his 20s interviewed Spacey for a magazine in London in the early 2000s and afterward went to a club with Spacey and some of his friends. He said Spacey repeatedly grabbed his genitals and angrily tried to block him from fleeing. The journalist realized he could not write about the encounter because it meant outing then-closeted Spacey as gay. \"If I were to publish a story about Kevin Spacey sexually harassing me on the job … there's no way without making it quite clear that he likes guys,\" he said.

He said he didn't believe anything sexual took place, but added, \"I was uncomfortable at best, traumatized at worst.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 14. Heather Unruh's son: The former Boston TV news anchor held a press conference Nov. 8 in Boston to accuse Spacey of groping the genitals of her then-18-year-old son in a bar on Nantucket, Mass., in July 2016. Unruh said her son filed a report on the allegation with police and \"a criminal investigation has been opened,\" though police said they could not confirm or deny that due to state law. If confirmed, his case would be the first under police investigation in America. And as the most recent, it could potentially lead to criminal charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 15. Andy Holtmzan: In 1981, the NYU grad was working at The Public Theater in New York when Spacey, then 22 and an up-and-coming actor with a minor role in their production of Henry IV, Part 1, committed what he termed a \"wordless assault.\" Holtzman told USA TODAY he was on a phone call when Spacey began his attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Within minutes, wordlessly, he was up and all over me,\" Holtzman, now a 64-year-old marketing consultant, recalled. \"The aggression was certainly more than a grope.

He was gay and comfortable with his sexuality but said he wasn't interested in Spacey, who was then in the closet.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was the look on his face that was really shocking and then scary,\" Holtzman said. \"The anger was undeserved.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Former news anchor says Spacey assaulted her son NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heather Unruh, a former TV news anchor in Boston, said in a press conference Wednesday that the Oscar-winning actor assaulted her son, who was 18 at the time. Holding back tears, Unruh said in July 2016 that Spacey stuck his hand in her son’s pants and on his genitals at a bar in Nantucket, Mass. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unruh said her son told Spacey he was of legal age to drink, and \"Spacey bought him drink after drink after drink and when my son was drunk, Spacey made his move and sexually assaulted him.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She continued, saying Spacey urged her intoxicated son to go to a private after-party to continue drinking, but a concerned bystander asked her son if he was OK. When he relayed that he was not, Unruh said the woman told her son to run and he did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nothing could’ve prepared my son for how that sexual assault would make him feel as a man,\" she said. \"It harmed him and it cannot be undone.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unruh said her son filed a police report last week and provided evidence to Nantucket police. She says a criminal investigation was opened, though the Nantucket Police Department declined to confirm that to USA TODAY, citing Massachusetts law forbidding it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tara Miltimore , assistant district attorney and spokeswoman for the Cape & Islands District Attorney's Office, confirmed to USA TODAY that \"an individual has provided information to the Nantucket Police regarding an allegation of an indecent assault and battery.\" She said the state statute of limitations for indecent assault and battery is six years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unruh said her son did not report the encounter to police because he was embarrassed and fearful. Now, she said, her son is \"committed to doing what he can to stop Kevin Spacey from victimizing anyone else.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She also had a message for the actor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"To Kevin Spacey I want to say this: Shame on you for what you did to my son and shame on you for using your apology to Anthony Rapp to come out as a gay man,\" she said. \"That was an appalling attempt to distract attention away from what you really are: a sexual predator. Your actions are criminal.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unruh appeared with attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who has represented victims of clergy sexual abuse, at a downtown Boston hotel. Garabedian, who also has represented an accuser of Bill Cosby, was portrayed in the Oscar-winning film, Spotlight, about The Boston Globe's investigation of clergy sexual abuse in the Boston Catholic archdiocese. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The civil claim against Kevin Spacey happened in Massachusetts and is well within the civil statute of limitations,\" Garabedian said. \"It is also within the criminal statute of limitations. I am informed that my client did speak to the Nantucket police department and they are conducting an investigation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spacey's reps did not immediately return USA TODAY's request for comment. Spacey issued a statement on Twitter following Rapp's allegations, saying he was \"beyond horrified\" and insisting he didn't remember the encounter. In the same statement, he came out as gay for the first time in public.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nWhy The Mali Coup Threatens All Of West Africa NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following the March 22 coup that ousted President Amadou Toumani Touré, the north of Mali is in the hands of a Tuareg rebellion. It is a rolling series of events that has leaders across the region worrying about similar threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR by: admin Tuaregs, like this man in Algeria, live in several different countries in North and West Africa (Garrondo) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LE MONDE/Worldcrunch NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The very existence of the West African country of Mali is currently under threat. The whole of the north of the country is in the hands of a Tuareg rebellion, which nothing seems able to stop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted on March 22 by a junta of captains calling themselves the National Council for the Recovery of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDRE). Taking advantage of the ensuing power vacuum in the capital Bamako, the rebels have gained possession of northern Mali at lightning speed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rebels, the majority of whom are members of the nomadic Tuareg people, refuse to be called Malian, and they want to establish an independent Tuareg state called Azawad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Currently the rebels only hold the northern part of Mali, but with potential reinforcements arriving from other areas of the Sahel, a transition zone between the Sahara in the north and the savannahs to the south, and in particular from neighboring Niger, that could all change. In the meantime, the Malian army is falling apart. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The captains who overthrew the president justified their actions by claiming to be working to end the decline of Mali. However, the coup has had precisely the opposite outcome. Despite the fall of city after city in the north over the past few days, the CNRDRE has not sent any troops north to defend the country from the rebels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Quick response, deep concerns NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR West African leaders are responding quickly to try and avoid an outright collapse of the Malian state, and they have reacted with commendable promptness. At the impetus of, in particular, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, a diplomatic emergency committee has been formed that is threatening the junta with heavy sanctions if it does not relinquish power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, none of the heads of states involved is entirely blameless. Some, like Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaoré, have faced mutinies in their own countries. The desire of the presidents of the region to return constitutional order to Bamako is therefore influenced by a certain degree of self-preservation. Who can blame them? Only recently emerging from the Ivorian crisis, with Guinea still fragile and Senegal only just managing to avoid serious upheaval following its electoral turmoil, West Africa could do without the collapse of Mali. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Bamako, regional pressures run counter to public opinion; Mali has developed a strong dislike for its neighbors’ interference. But at this stage the only options left are likely to be hard to implement, not least the junta stepping down as Sanago, president of CNRDRE, holds tight to power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The West African heads of state will need plenty more energy to achieve their joint objectives: firstly, getting the Malian military back to their barracks; and secondly, helping them to launch a counter-attack. If this doesn’t happen, the North will quickly be lost and the division of the country becomes an ever-growing threat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until now, West Africa’s efforts have met with relative indifference from the international community. It is imperative that the outside world offers its support and realizes that the situation in Mali will have significant consequences for the whole of the Sahel region.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Timbuktu's \"outstanding architectural wonders\" must be safeguarded, it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Separatist Tuareg rebels joined forces with Islamist fighters to take the town on Sunday, and residents have told the BBC that Islamic law is being imposed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The African Union has joined West African nations in imposing sanctions on Mali after a recent coup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, representatives from the new military leadership are in Nigeria for talks with the authorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The military junta overthrew Mali's government nearly two weeks ago, saying the campaign against the recent Tuareg rebellion had been poorly run. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Junta head Capt Amadou Sanogo has said the army is not leaving power, but has promised to consult local political forces to set up a transition body \"with the aim of organising peaceful, free, open and democratic elections in which we will not take part\".

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Landlocked Mali has to import all its fuel - and reporters say the country will struggle to survive an economic blockade. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the Tuareg rebels have taken advantage of the political situation and made rapid advances in the past few days - and now control of a third of the West African country, including the key northern towns of Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Timbuktu's literary patrimony... reveals a continent with an immensely rich literary and scientific heritage Writer Lydia Syson Why do we know Timbuktu? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rebels are divided into two groups - the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which wants independence for the northern Tuareg homelands, while Ansar Dine, which is linked to the North African branch of al-Qaeda, wants to remain part of Mali but impose Sharia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents in Gao and Kidal told the BBC that Islamist fighters have ransacked bars serving alcohol and banned Western music on local airwaves. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Timbuktu, people told the BBC that Ansar Dine members are going from door-to-door telling occupants that they now have to live by the principles of Islamic law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The BBC's Alou Diawara in the capital, Bamako, says some civilians are fleeing the central town of Mopti, fearing a rebel advance further south. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the UN refugee agency, since January the violence has uprooted more than 200,000 people, including around 100,000 who have fled the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tourist attraction NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Timbuktu - on the edge of the Sahara desert - is littered with impressive architecture, using mud and wood in a unique style. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Structures include the great mosques of Djingareyber, Sankore and Sidi Yahia and 16 cemeteries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are essential to the preservation of the identity of the people of Mali and of our universal heritage,\" Unesco head Irina Bokova said, calling on all parties to fulfil international obligations to safeguard heritage in times of war. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once an important centre of Islamic study, Timbuktu is home to about 700,000 ancient manuscripts, held in approximately 60 private libraries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"At its zenith in the middle of the 15th Century Timbuktu was known all over the world as a repository for all sorts of knowledge, including Arabic Islamic writing, science, maths and history,\" Lydia Syson, an expert on Mali, told the BBC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today, Timbuktu is poor and parts of it are sinking under the encroaching desert sands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nevertheless, in recent years a lot of money has been invested in trying to preserve Timbuktu's manuscripts, some of which have already been destroyed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many collections have been digitised and local scholars trained in how to interpret the literary treasures, most of which are family collections that have been handed down from generation to generation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright AFP Image caption Ancient family manuscripts have been handed down from generation to generation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rebel takeover could disrupt these efforts and prevent access to the manuscripts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What is so important about Timbuktu's literary patrimony is that it is a challenge to Western ideas that Africa is a land of song and dance and oral tradition,\" Ms Syson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It reveals a continent with an immensely rich literary and scientific heritage,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The UN Security Council is due to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis in Mali later on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The coup and Tuareg rebellion have exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Mali and some neighbouring countries, with aid agencies warning that 13 million people need food aid following a drought in the region.\nPassage 3:\nMalians lined up outside gas stations holding jerrycans, water bottles and plastic jugs, as the landlocked West African nation braced itself Tuesday for sanctions imposed overnight as a consequence of a coup last month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an effort to force out the soldiers that seized control of the country on March 21, Mali's neighbors decided at an emergency summit Monday to impose an embargo, shutting their borders and freezing its account at the regional central bank. The nation roughly twice the size of France imports all its fuel, which is trucked in overland from neighboring Ivory Coast and Senegal, both located on Africa's Atlantic Coast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The country's electricity grid is also expected to falter in coming weeks. April is one of the hottest months of the year in the country located on the southern edge of the Sahara desert, and the nation's hydropower system is unable to carry the load because of low water levels. Fuel is used in the hot months to run diesel generators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mali's president was sent into hiding when a group of disgruntled soldiers started a mutiny at a military base located around 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the presidential palace. From the base, they decided to march on the palace. In a matter of hours, they succeeded in reversing more than two decades of democracy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Economic Community of West African States, representing 15 nations in the region, has been uncharacteristically harsh in their condemnation of the coup. They gave the putschists a 72-hour deadline to restore civilian rule, which expired Monday. When the junta failed to do so, they announced that sanctions would go into effect immediately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bathily Seye, the owner of a local chain of gas stations called Afrique Oil, said that if no new shipments are allowed in, his 15 pumps will run dry in days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We don't have our own gas. It's all imported,\" he said. \"There is absolutely nothing here. We don't have any refining capacity. ... I don't have the stock. In two days, my pumps will run out of gas.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a Shell pump in downtown Bamako, the line of cars was so long Tuesday that the vehicles were idling on the highway leading to the station. At the front of the queue, farm employee Baba Kounta had climbed into the back of his minibus, where he was filling 12 20-liter jerrycans. He said he needs the gas to power the generators that run the irrigation system at the orange farm outside Bamako where he works. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We don't have a choice. We're obliged to make provisions,\" said Kounta, as he watched the gauge on the pump race past 73,700 francs (around $147). \"In the hot season, the generator eats 40 liters (more than 10 gallons) per day.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Waiting his turn behind the minibus was 50-year-old computer tech Nouhoum Kamate, who was sitting in the suffocating heat of his unventilated old-model Mercedes. A government employee, he had come to the gas station with his March paycheck. It's unclear if the junta will be able to pay civil servants in April because the country's bank account is now frozen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I got my salary this past month, but next month? I don't think we will get to that point,\" said Kamate. \"I think we will find a solution. They can't do this embargo forever.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The soldiers who grabbed power said they did so because of the former president's mishandling of an insurgency in the north by Tuareg rebels. Since the coup, however, the rebels have effectively seized control of the entire northern half of the nation, taking the three major towns of Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu over the weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A former minister, Mohamed Ag Erlaf, identified himself as the chief negotiator for Mali's junta and said the main rebel group that seized the north is willing to hold talks on the future of the country. Reached by telephone, Erlaf said Tuesday that the rebel National Movement for the Liberation of the Azawad is open to discussions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, an NMLA spokesman in Paris told France 24 TV late Monday that the rebels have had no direct contact with the junta which toppled Mali's government. Moussa Ag Attaher said they do not recognize coup leader Capt. Amadou Haya Sanogo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said: \"Neither the international community nor the population of Mali recognize him. If we are to negotiate, it needs to be with someone that is recognized.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Associated Press Writer Michelle Faul contributed to this report from Niamey, Niger.\n", "answers": ["Since we last checked in, the situation in Mali following a soldiers' coup has spiraled, with rising concerns over food and gas shortages, violence, and indeed the country's \"very existence,\" according to Le Monde. An update: The coup has driven more than 200,000 people from their homes to other parts of the region, the AP reports. The UN worries that major food shortages could be imminent, and \"mayhem in these towns and cities is increasing,\" says a rep. Neighboring countries have established an embargo against the rebels who ousted the president; they've closed off their borders and frozen the country's regional bank account. That has prompted residents of Mali, which imports all its fuel, to rush to gas stations to collect fuel. The country's electricity grid may also be headed for failure. UNESCO is citing a threat to Timbuktu, a World Heritage Site full of \"architectural wonders,\" notes the BBC.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nStarting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.\nPassage 2:\nIt was a black-and-white photograph in a newspaper. It showed a small boy, locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. His hands clutched what appeared to be chicken wire containing him, and his expression was agonised. There would be no Lumos – the charity dedicated to closing child institutions and so-called orphanages – if there hadn’t first been this picture. I knew the immediate shameful impulse to turn away, to hide the page, not to look. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I could try to justify that impulse by saying that I was pregnant at the time, feeling vulnerable and hormonal. The sad truth remains that my instinctive reaction to that picture could stand as a metaphor for the attitude that has enabled the unjustifiable incarceration of 8 million children around this world to take place with little outrage or comment. Ashamed of that reflexive refusal to look, I forced myself to turn back to the picture and read the article. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It told of a nightmarish institution where children as young as six were caged most of the day and night. I ripped the article out, and the following day I began writing letters to everybody I could think of with influence in the matter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These efforts led quickly to the establishment of Lumos, named for the spell I created in Harry Potter to bring light to some dark and frightening places. Part of our work in Lumos is to shed light on the lives of those millions of children separated from their families for reasons of poverty, disability and discrimination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shocking truth is that the vast majority of these children have parents that could care for them. They are not orphans. Most are placed in institutions by families who are too poor to provide for them, or because of a lack of local education and health facilities, especially for children with special needs. The minority who do not have parents, or for whom staying at home is not in their best interests, are often placed in institutions because there is no alternative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The idea of any child being taken from their family and locked away, all too often in atrocious conditions, is particularly poignant at this time of year. For children in institutions, life too often resembles the darkest of Grimms’ fairytales. Georgette Mulheir, CEO of Lumos, tells how one Christmas she took sweets to the 270 children in a particular institution. What she discovered there was nightmarish. It was minus 25 outside, the heating was broken, children lay shivering in their beds, dressed in all their clothes, wrapped in threadbare blankets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Again and again, when I quote the statistics to people who are not familiar with the field – 8 million children separated from their families worldwide – they are aghast and disbelieving. “How could that happen,” they ask, “without the whole world knowing?” The answer is really quite simple: who is easier to silence than a child? Especially a child with mental or physical disabilities, who is taken away from a family that has been convinced that it is for the best, or whose only alternative is watching that child starve. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is now a wealth of scientific proof that institutions cause children measurable and sometimes irreparable harm. Institutionalised children are far less likely to be educated and to be physically or mentally well. Malnutrition is all too common. They are many more times likely to be abused or trafficked. The effects on infants are particularly chronic, with many failing to thrive, or dying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The impact of not having the love and attention of a dedicated carer is profound. It can cause stunting, developmental delays and psychological trauma. I have seen babies who have learned not to cry because nobody comes. I have met children so desperate for affection that they will crawl into any stranger’s lap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Damage is done very early, and it is lasting. Cut off from society, institutionalised children return to the world with their chances of a happy, healthy life greatly impaired, often unable to find employment, excluded from the community and more likely to enter into a lifetime of poverty and dependency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A crucial point is that these dire effects apply to children from all kinds of institutions, including those that are well resourced. The solution is not pretty murals, or comfier beds, or teddy bears. The solution is no institutions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The good news is that this is an entirely solvable problem. Based on the successes already achieved in several countries, Lumos estimates that the institutionalisation of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 – in our lifetime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where there is investment in inclusive education and health, where vulnerable families receive support for poverty, employment and social and medical problems; where there are fostering, adoption or other family-based care alternatives for children who cannot be with their parents; and where the culture of institutionalisation is replaced by one that prioritises keeping families together, children can thrive within their own families and communities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR International donors play a vital role in this regard. The issues they choose to fund, and the principles they promote, greatly influence what support is available to children and families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ending the practice of keeping children in institutions isn’t just a moral imperative: it makes excellent economic sense. It is far more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution – and this also reduces long-term costs, since these children are far less likely to become dependent in adulthood. We know our model works. Since Lumos began working in Moldova in 2007, there has been a 70% reduction in the number of children in institutions nationally, despite chronic political instability and Moldova’s standing as the poorest country in Europe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Czech Republic, while the numbers of children being admitted into institutions has dropped by 16% nationally in the past year, in Lumos’s demonstration area they have achieved a 75% fall in admissions. It is eminently possible that by 2020 there will be no more children in institutions in the Czech Republic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since Lumos began working in Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has reduced by 54%. New admissions to institutions in Bulgaria have fallen by 34%, and the number of foster carers has increased by 440%, from 357 to more than 1600, providing the much-needed family environments for children who would otherwise be in institutions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is a critical time for getting children out of institutions. The commitments made by the EU, the US and the Global Alliance for Children – a grouping of public and private aid donors, and NGOs, of which Lumos is a key member – have set an important precedent for other donors. There is now a critical mass of expertise and evidence on which we can all build. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many millions of people around the world want to see an end to the harmful and unnecessary practice of institutionalisation. Everyone has a role to play in that regard, which is precisely the idea behind the social media campaign #letstalklumos launched last month. Keeping this issue alive and creating awareness is a vital part of changing the future for these children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life. It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The helicopter was damaged after making a hard landing at bin Laden’s compound. Navy SEALs destroyed part of it before leaving, in an effort to keep the latest U.S. military technology a secret. But the tail remained intact, and photos of it quickly made their way into public view. In the days after the operation, Pakistani intelligence officials said China had expressed interest in it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The handover of the helicopter tail, to be made Tuesday, is one result of several high-level meetings Kerry said he held with Pakistani officials to alleviate strains between the two allies. The long-fraught relationship has reached one of its worst points after U.S. commandos killed bin Laden in a Pakistani garrison city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pakistan has chafed at not being informed of the raid in advance, while U.S. officials have openly questioned whether Pakistani officials colluded with bin Laden. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kerry sought Monday to play down those allegations, saying he was in Pakistan to “recalibrate” the relationship, not judge whether Pakistan harbors terrorists. But he said he and Pakistani officials had discussed several points of contention, including Pakistan’s alleged support for Afghan insurgents based on its soil and for Lashkar-i-Taiba, a Pakistani militant organization that has been accused of carrying out attacks in India and Afghanistan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kerry, whose name is attached to a major U.S. economic assistance package to Pakistan, said he conveyed to the Pakistanis that they must demonstrate a commitment to fighting Islamist militancy to address the concerns of members of Congress who, after the bin Laden killing, have called for the end to U.S. aid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The make-or-break is real,” said Kerry, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the most senior U.S. envoy to visit Pakistan since bin Laden’s death. “There are members of Congress who aren’t confident that [the relationship] can be patched back together again. That is why actions, not words, are going to be critical to earning their votes.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kerry did not specify other steps agreed to during his meetings, although he said commitments were made to increase U.S.-Pakistan intelligence sharing and joint intelligence operations — areas that had come to a near standstill in recent months. A joint U.S.-Pakistan statement issued Monday said the countries would cooperate in operations against “high-value targets” in Pakistan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In coming days, senior White House officials will visit Pakistan to discuss implementation of what Kerry called the “road map.” Those discussions will determine whether Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will move forward with plans to visit Pakistan this month, said Kerry, although he suggested there is little prospect that the nations would break ties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States uses Pakistan as a key supply route for U.S. troops in Afghanistan, and Pakistan’s assistance is viewed as crucial to a potential negotiated end to the war there. At worst, some U.S. officials say, cutting ties with Islamabad could destabilize the government to the point that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal falls into the hands of Islamists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pakistan, meanwhile, needs U.S. assistance to help arm its military and shore up its teetering economy. And although anti-U.S. sentiment is widespread, Pakistan also depends on the cachet of being allied with a superpower — particularly in view of poor relations with its neighbors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani began a four-day visit to China, an old, trusted ally of Pakistan with superpower aspirations of its own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A continued downward spiral in U.S.-Pakistan ties, Kerry said, “is a very dangerous road for everybody — dangerous for Pakistan, dangerous for our interests, dangerous for the people of this country and for the region.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In recent days, Pakistani civilian and military officials have coalesced around anger about the bin Laden raid, which they characterize as a violation of sovereignty. On Friday, Parliament passed a resolution condemning the operation, calling for an end to CIA drone strikes and threatening to cut off NATO supply routes through Pakistan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kerry said he emphasized to Pakistani leaders that the secrecy surrounding the Abbottabad operation was not a reflection of U.S. distrust. Having narrowly failed to reach bin Laden in Afghanistan in 2001, the United States was determined this time to avoid leaks at all costs, Kerry said, and few senior U.S. officials were told in advance about the raid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “My goal in coming here was not to apologize for what I consider to be a triumph against terrorism,” Kerry said of the raid on bin Laden’s compound. He added: “Faced with a second chance to capture Osama bin Laden, no American president could conceivably have afforded to take even the slightest chance that he might again slip through our hands.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The joint statement said Kerry had also assured Pakistan that the United States has “no designs” on its nuclear arsenal. It did not mention drone strikes, which Pakistan tacitly allows but publicly protests. One such strike in the border area of North Waziristan killed seven people Monday, according to the Associated Press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The militant threat in Pakistan was highlighted earlier in the day in the southern port of Karachi, where gunmen on a motorbike fatally shot a Saudi diplomat as he was driving. A senior police official in Karachi said investigators were trying to determine whether militants related to al-Qaeda, which opposes the Saudi regime, had carried out the attack to avenge the killing of the Saudi-born bin Laden. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the official said the assassination of the diplomat, which came two days after hand grenades were lobbed at Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Karachi, might also have been carried out by Shiites angry that the kingdom had sent troops to Bahrain to suppress Shiite protests there.

Police in Malaysia... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — The banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent was used to kill Kim Jong Nam, the North Korean ruler's outcast half brother who was poisoned last week at the airport in Kuala Lumpur, police said Friday. The announcement raised serious questions about public safety in a building that authorities went 11 days without decontaminating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The substance, deadly even in minute amounts, was detected on Kim's eyes and face, Malaysia's inspector general of police said in a written statement, citing a preliminary analysis from the country's Chemistry Department. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our preliminary finding of the chemical that caused the death of Kim Chol was VX nerve,\" said Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar. Kim Chol is the name on the passport found on the victim, but a Malaysian official previously confirmed he is North Korea leader Kim Jong Un's older half brother. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Khalid told reporters that one of the two women accused of wiping the toxin on Kim's face was later sickened and suffered from vomiting. He declined to say which of the women — one Indonesian and one Vietnamese — had gotten sick. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Khalid said police were still investigating how the lethal agent entered Malaysia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police previously said the airport had not been decontaminated. Asked Friday in a text message whether that was still the case, Khalid said, \"We are doing it now.\" Details were not immediately clear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Malaysian police also previously no one besides Kim Jong Nam had been sickened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If VX was used, it could have contaminated not only the airport but anyplace else Kim had been, including medical facilities and the ambulance he was transported in. The nerve agent, which has the consistency of motor oil, can take days or even weeks to evaporate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The death of Kim Jong Nam, whose daylight assassination in a crowded airport terminal seems straight out of a spy novel, has unleashed a diplomatic crisis that escalates by the day. With each new twist in the case, international speculation has grown that Pyongyang dispatched a hit squad to Malaysia to kill the exiled older sibling of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korea has denounced Malaysia's investigation as full of \"holes and contradictions\" and accused the authorities here of being in cahoots with Pyongyang's enemies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Malaysian investigators, the two female suspects coated their hands with chemicals and wiped them on Kim's face on Feb. 13 as he waited for a flight home to Macau, where he lived with his family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He sought help from airport staff but he fell into convulsions and died on the way to the hospital within two hours of the attack, police said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case has perplexed toxicologists, who question how the two women could have walked away unscathed after handling a powerful poison, even if — as Malaysian police say — the women were instructed to wash their hands right after the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Bruce Goldberger, a leading toxicologist who heads the forensic medicine division at the University of Florida, said even a tiny amount of VX nerve agent — equal to a few grains of salt — is capable of killing. It can be administered through the skin, and there is an antidote that can be administered by injection. U.S. medics and military personnel carried kits with them on the battlefield during the Iraq war in case they were exposed to the chemical weapon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a very toxic nerve agent. Very, very toxic,\" he said. \"I'm intrigued that these two alleged assassins suffered no ill effect from exposure to VX. It is possible that both of these women were given the antidote.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said symptoms from VX would generally occur within seconds or minutes and could last for hours starting with confusion, possible drowsiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, runny nose and watery eyes. Prior to death, there would likely be convulsions, seizures, loss of consciousness and paralysis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR VX is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which North Korea never signed. The country is believed by outside experts to have the capacity to produce up to 4,500 metric tons of chemical weapons during a typical year, which it could increase to 12,000 tons per year during a period of crisis. Its current inventory has been estimated at 2,500 to 5,000 tons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is suspected of being particularly focused on mustard, phosgene, sarin and V-type chemical agents — substances including VX that are designed to poison through contact and remain lethal for long periods of time. The North's development of such agents has been of special concern because of fears it might try to put them in artillery shells for an attack on South Korea's capital, potentially threatening the lives of millions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph Bermudez, a well-known North Korea analyst, wrote an article for the respected 38 North website in 2013 that said the North is capable of not only employing \"significant quantities and varieties of chemical weapons\" across the Korean Peninsula but also using those weapons worldwide \"using unconventional methods of delivery.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also said there is a \"growing body of evidence\" indicating the North has shared chemical weapons capabilities with Syria, Iran and others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Malaysia has three people in custody in connection with Kim Jong Nam's death, including the two suspected attackers. Authorities are also seeking several other people, including the second secretary of North Korea's embassy in Kuala Lumpur and an employee of North Korea's state-owned airline, Air Koryo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case has marked a serious turnaround in relations between Malaysia and North Korea. While Malaysia isn't one of Pyongyang's key diplomatic partners, it is one of the few places in the world where North Koreans can travel without a visa. As a result, for years, it's been a quiet destination for Northerners looking for jobs, schools and business deals.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR which is attached to this letter). As provided by clause 11(g) of Rule of the House of NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives, the Committee has forwarded this Memorandum to the President based on its NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR determination that the release of the Memorandum would serve the public interest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Constitution vests the President with the authority to protect national security secrets from it NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR disclosure. As the Supreme Court has recognized, it is the President?s responsibility to classify, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR declassify, and control access to information bearing on our intelligence sources and methods NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR and national defense. See, Dep of Navy v. Egan, 484 US. 518, 527 (1988). In order to NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR facilitate appropriate congressional oversight, the Executive Branch may entrust classi?ed NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR information to the appropriate committees of Congress, as it has done in connection with the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Committee?s oversight activities here. The Executive Branch does so on the assumption that the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Committee will responsibly protect such classi?ed information, consistent with the laws of the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Committee has now determined that the release of the Memorandum would be appropriate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Executive Branch, across Administrations of both parties, has worked to accommodate NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR congressional requests to declassify speci?c materials in the public interest.1 However, public NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR release of classi?ed information by unilateral action of the Legislative Branch is extremely rare NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR and raises signi?cant separation of powers concerns. Accordingly, the Committee?s request to NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR release the Memorandum is interpreted as a request for declassi?cation pursuant to the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President?s authority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The President understands that the protection of our national security represents his highest NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR obligation. Accordingly, he has directed lawyers and national security staff to assess the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1 See, e. S.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR declassi?cation request, consistent with established standards governing the handling of NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR classi?ed information, including those under Section 3.1(d) of Executive Order 13526. Those NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR standards permit declassi?cation when the public interest in disclosure outweighs any need to NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR protect the information. The White House review process also included input from the Of?ce of NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice. Consistent with this review NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR and these standards, the President has determined that declassification of the Memorandum is NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR appropriate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Based on this assessment and in light of the signi?cant public interest in the memorandum, the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President has authorized the declassi?cation of the Memorandum. To be clear, the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Memorandum re?ects the judgments of its congressional authors.

Our ?ndings, which are detailed below, 1) raise concerns with NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surveillance Court (FISC), and 2) represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR to protect the American people from abuses related to the ISA process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigation Update NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - On October 21, 2016, DOJ and FBI sought and received a ISA probable cause order NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (up; under Title VII) authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page from the FISC. Page is a NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR US citizen who served as a volunteer advisor to the Trump presidential campaign. Consistent . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR with requirements under FISA, the application had to be ?rst certi?ed by the Director or Deputy NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Director of the FBI. It then required the approval of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR General (DAG), or the Senate?con?rmed Assistant Attorney General for the National Security NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Division. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FBI and DOJ obtained one initial FISA warrant targeting Carter Page and three FISA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR renewals from the FISC. As required by statute (50 U.S.C. a FISA order on an NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American citizen must be renewed by the ISC every 90 days and each renewal requires a NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR separate finding of probable cause. Then-Director James Comey signed three FISA applications NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR . in question on behalf of the FBI, and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sally Yates, then-Acting DAG Dana Boente, and DAG Rod Rosenstein each signed one or more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FISA applications on behalf of NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Due to the sensitive nature of foreign intelligence activity, FISA submissions (including NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR renewals) before the ISC are classified. As such, the public?s con?dence in the integrity of the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FISA process depends on the court?s ability to hold the government to the highest standard?? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR particularly as it relates to surveillance of American citizens. However, the rigor in NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR protecting the rights of Americans, which is reinforced by 90?day renewals of surveillance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR orders, is necessarily dependent on the government?s production to the court of all material and NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR relevant facts. This should include information potentially favorable to the target of the FISA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TGIF-SEW NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR application that is known by the government. In the case of Carter Page, the government had at NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR least four independent opportunities before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR relevant facts. However, our ?ndings indicate that, as described below, material and relevant NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR information was omitted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ?dossier?- compiled by Christopher Steele (Steele dossier) on behalf of the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton campaign formed an NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR essential part of the Carter Page FISA application. Steele was a longtime FBI source who NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR was paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign, via the law ?rm Perkins Coie NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR and research ?rm Fusion GPS, to obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump?s ties NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR to Russia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR a) Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or. any party/campaign in funding NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steele?s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR known to senior and FBI of?cials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR b) The initial FISA application notes Steele was working for a named US. person, but NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR does not name Fusion GPS and principal Glenn Simpson, who was paid by a US. law NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ?rm (Perkins Coie) representing the DNC (even though it was known by DOI at the, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR time that political actors were involved with the Steele dossier). The application does NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR not mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of?and paid by?wthe DNC and NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton campaign, or that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele for the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR same information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016, Yahoo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR News article by- Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page?s July 2016 trip to Moscow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR - This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News. The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News. Steele has admitted in NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British court ?lings that he met with Yahoo Newly?and several other. outlets?in NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele?s NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington DC. in NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR a) Steele was suspended and then terminated as an FBI source for what the FBI de?nes NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR as the most serious of violations?an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR relationship with the FBI in an October 30, 2016, Mother Jones article by David NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Corn Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yahoo and other outlets' 1n September?before the Page application was submitted to NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PROPERTY OF THE US. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR the FISC in October-but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR those contacts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR b) Steele?s numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR handling?maintaining con?dentiality?and demonstrated that Steele had become a NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR less than reliable source for the FBI. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before and after Steele was terminated as a source, he maintained contact with DOJ via NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce 0hr, a senior DOJ of?cial who worked NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR closely with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein. Shortly after the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR election, the FBI began interviewing 0hr, documenting his communications with Steele. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to 0hr his feelings against then- NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR candidate Trump when Steele said he ?was desperate that Donald Trump not get NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR elected and was passionate about him not, being president.? This clear evidence of . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Steele? bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in of?cial FBI ?les?but NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR not re?ected in any of the Page FISA applications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR a) During this same time period, Ohr?s wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR the cultivation of opposition research on Trump. Ohr later provided the FBI with all NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR of his wife?s opposition research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fusion GPS. The Ohrs? relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR concealed from the FISC. . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the head of the counterintelligence division, Assistant Director Bill NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Priestap, corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its ?infancy? at the time of the initial NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Page FISA application. After Steele was terminated, a source validation report conducted NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele?s reporting as only minimally NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR corroborated. Yet, in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR on a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was??according to his June 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR and unveri?ed.? While the FISA application relied on Steele?s NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR anti?Trump ?nancial and ideological motivations. Furthermore, Deputy Director NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCabe testi?ed before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.

The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nWolfman, The HORROR: United States, 2010 U.S. Release Date: 2010-02-12 Running Length: 1:45 MPAA Classification: R (Violence) Theatrical Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1 Cast: Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, Hugo Weaving, Geraldine Chaplin, Art Malik Director: Joe Johnston Screenplay: Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self, based on the 1941 screenplay by Curt Siodmak Cinematography: Shelly Johnson Music: Danny Elfman U.S. Distributor: Universal Pictures Subtitles: none NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of the great Universal horror movies from the 1930s and 1940s have now been remade: Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, and The Wolf Man. Over the years, there have been numerous cinematic encounters with lycanthropy, but The Wolf Man is to werewolves what Dracula is to vampires. He is unique. Since Lon Chaney Jr. cast aside the mantle of Lawrence Talbot following his run-in with Abbott and Costello in 1948, no one has picked it up... until now. In accepting the part, Benicio Del Toro isn't playing a werewolf; he is playing the werewolf. For most long-time horror fans, Chaney's portrayal of the tortured Talbot and his vicious alter-ego is as iconic as can be found in the annals of the \"monster movie.\" Del Toro's lack of success, therefore, may be unwelcome but it is not entirely unexpected. It's hard to work in the long shadow cast by the likes of Karloff, Lugosi, or Chaney, but unavoidable when re-making one of their movies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The root problem with The Wolfman is that it's a hybrid. It tries to fuse the gothic storytelling of the original with the violence and gore associated with modern horror. Its wedding of traditional makeup with CGI is uneasy. Director Joe Johnston wants this movie to be the bridge between the restrained, atmosphere-soaked Universal horror classic and the grotesque likes of An American Werewolf in London and The Howling. It doesn't work. Parts of The Wolfman - even those that were effective in the original - have been recreated in a fashion that seems more Monty Python than unsettling. More disappointing is the makeup provided by veteran Rick Baker (the go-to man for this sort of work), which looks inexcusably campy. The fangs look like they were purchased at a Halloween costume store and, during the big werewolf-on-werewolf clash, I was reminded of Bigfoot from The Six Million Dollar Man. One has to wonder whether Baker's decision to remain true to the general appearance of the original Wolf Man is the right one. Nostalgia isn't always the best barometer by which to make creative decisions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The action, which elects to retain a period piece flavor rather than time-shift the story, takes place in the 1890s on the moors of rural England. There stands the estate of Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), whose son Ben has disappeared. The other Talbot heir, Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro), now a touring stage actor, answers a plea from his brother's fiancé, Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt), to come home and search for the missing man. By the time Lawrence reaches Talbot Hall, a mangled body has been found and a funeral has been arranged. Lawrence, determined to find the beast responsible for his brother's death, begins a hunt that leads him to a gypsy camp. While there, he is attacked by a half-man/half-wolf. The gypsy woman Maleva (Geraldine Chaplin) sutures the wound, but pronounces Lawrence to be cursed: \"Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.\" Indeed, at the time of the next full moon, Lawrence is transformed and goes on a bloody rampage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his portrayal of Talbot, Del Toro pays homage to Chaney, almost to the point of imitation. Unfortunately, this results in a neutered and muted character. Like Chaney's Talbot, Del Toro's interpretation is that of a man tortured and filled with self-loathing. However, the emotional connection is not there. As a human being, Talbot generates no empathy; the character fails to excite our emotions. The filmmakers have surrounded Del Toro with a respectable supporting staff, but it amounts to a waste of talent. Anthony Hopkins, in his second classic horror remake (he was Van Helsing in Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula), pops up now and again looking malevolent, but Sir John is more a necessity of the plot than a legitimate character. Emily Blunt's thankless role as the \"love interest\" limits her screen time and her opportunity to look fetching in 19th century garb. With the exception of one scene, she functions as underused eye candy. As a Scotland Yard inspector assigned to investigate the killings, Hugo Weaving defines superfluous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Wolfman had been searching for a director for some time before Johnston was brought on board. His experience with Jumanji and Jurassic Park III convinced the producers he could handle a film with a high number of special effects sequences and a sizeable budget. At best, the results are mixed. 20 years ago, the effects work in The Wolfman might have been hailed as revolutionary; today, it looks dated. The violence is bloody and graphic but it doesn't make the movie better, merely R-rated. Attempts to re-create the original's haunting atmosphere are middling - something is lost in the transition from black & white to color. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even more so than Coppola's Dracula, Branagh's Frankenstein, and Sommers' The Mummy, The Wolfman seems unnecessary. Although not coming close to the level of a misfire that represented Van Helsing, this production nevertheless illustrates that it takes more to remake a beloved classic than re-working the story and taking a by-the-numbers approach. There are enough little details to indicate that the filmmakers were familiar with the original. Such familiarity did not result in a better product and the well-publicized re-shoots didn't save the movie from the graveyard of mediocrity into which its unintentional campiness and underwhelming special effects have consigned it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Discuss this topic in the ReelViews Forums.\nPassage 2:\nGhostly clouds drift across a haloed moon; dry twigs snap in a darkening wood; a covey of woodcock bolts from the undergrowth—startling, for a moment, a solitary traveler. He takes a deep breath. It turns out to be his last. Yes, that furry face seen in an almost subliminal flash was the feral beast lurking within \"The Wolfman,\" a film that begins in an eerie gothic mist of suggestion—and turns into a toothless exercise in the obvious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This updating of the old Universal horror franchise is among the more visually beautiful fright films ever photographed, and all the more disappointing for it. Directed by Joe Johnston (\"Hidalgo,\" \"October Sky,\" \"The Rocketeer\"), the movie is scary only as regards all its wasted potential—the color-drained, unnerving look; the inky black accents; the deliberate pacing; the occasional hint that the director understands the potency of implication. It's all here, in grains and drams. So is an accelerating sense of inanity, as all the movie's elements are reduced to a gruesome fondue, accessorized by actorly ham and studio cheese. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It may be that this \"Wolfman\"—which revives a storyline based more on Hollywood mythology than any particular ethnic fable—was misshapen from the cradle. The usually admirable Benicio Del Toro, portraying Victorian stage actor/lycanthrope-to-be Lawrence Talbot, is the worst casting choice in recent memory: Too old and plush to play the Byronic hero, he's also burdened with a modified Moe Howard haircut and a voice that loses us at \"Hello\"—a greeting that Mr. Del Toro delivers with all the authority and resonance of the Kim Jong Il marionette in the South Park team's \"Team America.\" (I'm sorry; I can't get him out of my mind). Mr. Del Toro's Talbot, returning to his family's ancestral mansion in 1891 Blackmoor, finds that his missing brother's shredded corpse has been discovered in a drainage ditch and that his father (Anthony Hopkins) has apparently been dipping into the laudanum cabinet. As his fellow Blackmoorites, fueled by vigilante instincts and invective from the pulpit, pursue the \"local lunatic,\" Lawrence transitions from hunter to hunted: A bite from the marauding creature dooms him to a future as a hairy homicidal maniac, one who can remove the limbs, heads and even hearts of his pursuers so quickly he can barely be seen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Universal Pictures Benicio Del Toro as 'The Wolfman.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eventually, the Wolfman, like his movie, slows down—what good is state-of-the-art makeup and effects if no one gets to study them? Unlike the succession of glass plates used in 1941's \"The Wolf Man,\" through which we viewed the moon-induced metamorphosis of Lon Chaney Jr., it is computerized orthopaedics that accomplish Lawrence's transition from man to wolf: His limbs contort, his face is twisted into a befanged grimace, his fingers sprout claws the size of fish knives. In keeping with wolfish tradition, it's an agonizing process, which may account for the creature's ill temper upon becoming fully lupine: He doesn't kill to feed any need besides bloodlust, and his eviscerations are graphic, grotesque and largely unnecessary—although when Mr. Del Toro is seen chowing down on some villager's liver, it may be intended as an homage to his somnambulistic co-star Mr. Hopkins (hold the fava beans). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are other allusions—to waterboarding, during a scene in which Lawrence is subjected to the primitive therapies of an asylum quack; to religious extremism, when the local preacher ascribes the crimes of the Wolfman to divine retribution for unspecified sins. Emily Blunt, who ought to be perplexed finding herself in a movie so unhinged, is the only human element here that's remotely convincing, plausible or attractive; she's sexier than ever as the dead brother's fiancée, and gives a subtle performance amid a din of dramatic braying. Ultimately, though, \"The Wolfman\" is a horror thriller that couldn't have been made any worse by the addition of Abbott & Costello. \"Sometimes, the way of fate is a cruel one,\" mutters \"The Wolfman's\" standard-issue, Maria Ouspenskaya-inspired creepy gypsy woman (a befossiled Geraldine Chaplin). No kidding, lady. Despite a solid conceit, a rather Brontë-esque Ms. Blunt, and sufficient computer effects to amuse James Cameron, this \"Wolfman\" is enough to make your hair fall out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Valentine's Day' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking of horror, director Garry Marshall's latest atrocity, \"Valentine's Day,\" might be described as a Repression-Era Special—an econo-pak of Hollywood second- and third-stringers, a couple of genuine stars (Anne Hathaway, Julia Roberts), and a couple of annoying movie kids brought together by a poverty of ideas and a director whose only apparent instruction to his cast was \"Act like the people in TV commercials.\" With enough sticky sweetness to make your teeth ache, \"Valentine's Day\" deploys every rom-com cliché, minus the com—there's isn't a laugh in the movie, unless you count a fleeting sequence featuring comedian Larry Miller, who's also probably the least prominent member of the cast (which includes Bradley Cooper, Emma Roberts, Jessica Alba, Patrick Dempsey, Shirley MacLaine, Hector Elizondo, Queen Latifah and George Lopez). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Warner Bros. Pictures Jennifer Garner plays Julia Fitzpatrick in 'Valentine's Day.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If that lineup wasn't frightening enough, Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner are the ostensible leads, she a schoolteacher blissfully unaware that her boyfriend (Mr. Dempsey) is married; he a flower-shop owner who has just proposed, bedside, to his girlfriend (Ms. Alba), who apparently has someone do her hair while she sleeps. The foreshadowings are like billboards: When a movie woman looks thoughtful rather than delirious at the sight of an engagement ring, things don't bode well for the match. Neither does an affiancing that arrives so early in the story. As each character negotiates his/her own rocky road to romance, each of the interlocking episodes inflicts its own particular kind of pain on the viewer, who will wonder how any of this happened. So might the performers, who will have a few questions for the gods, and their agents: Taylor Swift, the multiple-Grammy-winning singer, is nothing short of mortifying as a ditzy high-school student in love with another Taylor (\"Twilight's\" Mr. Lautner). Jamie Foxx continues his post-\"Ray\" slide into self-parody. Topher Grace makes the world safe for innocuous ingénues. Director Marshall, grand poobah of the puerile and pandering, creates a shameless movie world for which no actor had to travel too far from home in Beverly Hills/Brentwood, no one seemed to have worked more than a day to complete his or her abbreviated role, and where Jessica Biel can't get a date. Right. Red, the hue that dominates this movie's palette, is the color associated with both Valentine's Day and the devil. And there's something vaguely satanic about \"Valentine's Day.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Ajami' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enlarge Image Close coming Fouad Habash as Nasri in 'Ajami.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If a movie can ever be perfect, it may be so only in its particular moment. This is \"Ajami\"'s moment. An Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, this Arab-Israeli drama set on the mean streets of Jaffa is an urgent, immediate, jarring-but-fluid, multicharacter portrayal of Arab life in an Israel ghetto (the 'hood of the title), where a drive-by killing provides the overture to a city-wide opera of revenge, death, drugs and star-crossed love. The co-directors/co-writers, Palestinian Scandar Copti and Israeli Yaron Shani, possess a Tarantino-esque blitheness about startling violence, and employ a \"Pulp Fiction\" approach to narrative-as-mosaic. But they also advance the technique of fracturing time, using the backward glances into their sad, sad stories as a way of revealing details that enrich and alter the viewer's perspective on what's happening among the movie's largely Arabic population. While the disposability of life on screen mirrors the disposability of life on the Ajami streets, one's immediate impulse is to describe the film as apolitical: Its conflicts, after all, are largely tribal, insular and produced by the Arabs' own pressure-cooker mentality. But, of course, nothing could be more political. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Red Riding Trilogy' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It may lack vampires and blue people, but the already much-discussed \"Red Riding Trilogy\" is perhaps the moviegoing event of the year. Adapted by Tony Grisoni from David Peace's four novels based on the '70s-'80s Yorkshire Ripper murders, it's an all-star showcase for contemporary British/Irish acting and the gifts of Julian Jarrold, James Marsh and Anand Tucker, who directed parts one, two and three, respectively. Terrific performances are turned in by leads Paddy Considine (part 2) and David Morrissey (part 3), but it is Andrew Garfield—as the young reporter who suspects that the Ripper case is being used as a cover for a child-sex ring involving the entirety of a sordid Yorkshire constabulary—who establishes himself as one of the more gifted young actors around. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reminiscent of the best British TV crime series (\"Prime Suspect,\" to name one), \"RRT\" delves far deeper into the heart of darkness than its predecessors have ventured, or where most contemporary filmmakers dare to go. Produced by and aired last year on the U.K.'s Channel Four, it is taut, disturbing, wonderfully awful and, at 307 minutes, epic. \"Red Riding\" will eventually wend its way back to the small screen, but can continue to be seen in the proportions it deserves at the IFC Center in Manhattan, or, beginning today, at the Nuart in West Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —John Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DVD Focus 'The Wolf Man' (1941) The first in Lon Chaney Jr.'s string of Wolf Man appearances features the formidable cast of Claude Rains, Ralph Bellamy, Bela Lugosi and, of course, Maria Ouspenskaya, who basically tells Chaney's Larry Talbot that he's doomed. The story is by the German-born Curt Siodmak, several of whose novels (\"Donovan's Brain,\" \"The Beast With Five Fingers\") were turned into movies and whose \"Wolf Man\" script extrapolated from a number of legends, and employed the famous verse, \"Even a man who is pure in heart / And says his prayers by night / May become a Wolf when the Wolfbane blooms / And the Moon is full and bright.\" 'An American Werewolf in London' (1981) Among the many werewolf knockoffs (\"I Was a Teenage Werewolf,\" \"The Werewolf,\" \"Werewolf Woman\") is this quasicomic take from John (\"Animal House\") Landis, in which a backpacking American tourist (David Naughton) is bitten by a creature that none of the locals will admit exists. All the songs titles, by the way, contain the word \"moon\" (\"Bad Moon Rising,\" \"Moondance,\" \"Blue Moon,\" etc). 'Wolf' (1994) Casting Jack Nicholson as a wolfish man doesn't seem much of a stretch, but director Mike Nichols, working from a script by Jim Harrison and Wesley Strick, created an extended metaphor for American business and American manhood by moving the werewolf legend into the publishing world. There, traditionalist book publisher Will Randall (Nicholson) is under siege by a ruthless media mogul (Christopher Plummer) and an underhanded rival (James Spader). Under siege, that is, until a werewolf bite turns Will into a corporate cutthroat, sexual beast and type AAA personality. John Anderson NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR —John Anderson\nPassage 3:\nAwROOOOoooo! What are dignified, award-worthy thespians like Benicio del Toro, Emily Blunt, and Sir Anthony Hopkins doing in a piece of old-school hokum like “The Wolfman’’? Having the time of their lives while trying to keep a straight face. The movie is by no means good but it’s surprisingly enjoyable: a misty, moody Saturday-matinee monster-chiller-horror special that hits the same sweet spot for moviegoers of a certain age (cough) as those snap-together Frankenstein model kits from the late 1960s. You can practically smell the Duco cement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, the Wolfman was always the poor relation of the Universal Studio horror crew. The Frankenstein monster and Dracula got there first and had defining stars in Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi; 1935’s “Werewolf of London’’ had the dull-as-dirt Henry Hull. (Nifty transformation scene, though, and points for inspiring Warren Zevon.) It was only with 1941’s “The Wolfman’’ that movie lycanthropy got a face: poor, hulking Lon Chaney Jr., who always suggested a football player who’d been forced to take over the family watchmaking business. That first “Wolfman’’ isn’t a very good movie, either, so it’s not like the new one is sullying hallowed ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the contrary, director Joe Johnston (“Honey, I Shrunk the Kids’’) and writers Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self, working from Curt Siodmak’s 1941 script, treat the hairy old cliches with reverence. Set in 1891 in the fictional hamlet of Blackmoor, England, the new “Wolfman’’ lets the fog machines rip from frame one, and every time an offscreen wolf howls you may find yourself giggling uncontrollably. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an inspired casting touch, Benicio del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot, a traveling actor returning to his ancestral manse to bury his brother (Simon Merrells) and confront the family demons. Since del Toro already looks like the missing link - he has a hairline lower than Butch Patrick on “The Munsters’’ - this gives the makeup team only half the work to do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hopkins staggers merrily around as the unfathomably decadent Sir John Talbot, cradling a gun as if he were re-enacting his post-stroke scenes from “Legends of the Fall.’’ With tremulous conviction, Blunt plays Gwen Conliffe, the brother’s fiancée who’s drawn to the tormented Lawrence after he’s bitten one eldritch evening and starts staring fixedly at her neck. Since the original film’s Maria Ouspenskaya is long dead - not that that would have stopped her from chewing the scenery - Geraldine Chaplin has been drafted to play the aged Gypsy woman Maleva, issuing dire warnings and asking Gwen, “Vill you condemn him or vill you set him free?’’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One caveat: Because this is the 21st century and the multiplex circus demands blood, the new “Wolfman’’ is trendily gory. The violence erupts in brief, visceral spasms rather than prolonged wallowing, and I was cheered to see the Wolfman tear loose a victim’s liver in one scene, like a dog going straight for the Liv-a-Snaps. Mostly, though, Johnston busies himself with atmosphere and mood; this is a more faithful updating of Universal horror tropes than the recent “Mummy’’ desecrations, and it has its very real, if goofy, pleasures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The transformation scenes come courtesy of makeup effects legend Rick Baker, who doesn’t dwell on the details as he did in 1981’s “An American Werewolf in London.’’ They’re shown off best in the movie’s strongest scene, in which Talbot is trussed to a chair in a medical amphitheater, surrounded by Victorian doctors curious to see what happens when the full moon rises. (The payoff is delicious - for Lawrence.) As with all monster movies, though, the more you see the sillier it gets, and the climax of “The Wolfman,’’ with two Oscar-winning actors in fur masks going at it tooth and talon, plays like a tussle at the pound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Del Toro, sadly, is a bit of a dud in the title role, reciting his ornate period dialogue in an embarrassed monotone. Or maybe he’s just channeling Lon Chaney Jr. Hard to say. “The Wolfman’’ knows the old horror classics had pure pulp running through their veins, and it honors those cheap thrills with gusto. This isn’t a great movie - it’s just a good dog. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ty Burr can be reached at tburr@globe.com. For more on movies, go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Here’s what they’re saying: “The movie is pungent with atmosphere, laying down a thick fog of creepy Victorian murk,” writes Kyle Smith of the New York Post, but the story is toothless, centering on a mystery “so simple that even Marmaduke could have sniffed it out.” “The movie is scary only as regards all its wasted potential,” laments John Anderson of the Wall Street Journal.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nDavis discloses terminating pregnancy in her memoir NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AUSTIN - Sen. Wendy Davis, in her memoir due out next week, discloses the most personal of stories preceding her nationally marked fight against tighter abortion restrictions: a decision she and her then-husband made 17 years ago to end a much-wanted pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book, “Forgetting to Be Afraid,” goes on sale to the general public Tuesday. Copies will be available Monday at a Fort Worth book signing by Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis, in a copy of the book obtained by the San Antonio Express-News, wrote that her unborn third daughter had an acute brain abnormality. She said doctors told her the syndrome would cause the baby to suffer and likely was incompatible with life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After getting several medical opinions and feeling the baby they had named Tate Elise “tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her” in the womb, she said the decision was clear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She was suffering,” Davis wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unborn baby's heart was “quieted” by her doctor, and their baby was gone. She was delivered by cesarean section in spring 1997, the memoir says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis wrote that she and her then-husband, Jeff, spent time with Tate the next day and had her baptized. They cried, took photographs and said their good-byes, she wrote, and Tate's lifeless body was taken away the following day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “An indescribable blackness followed. It was a deep, dark despair and grief, a heavy wave that crushed me, that made me wonder if I would ever surface. ... And when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person. Changed. Forever changed,” Davis wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 304-page hardcover is priced at $27.97 from Blue Rider Press, and imprint of the Penguin Group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book's title comes from a Lady Bird Johnson quote: “Become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abortion rights have been a major undercurrent in the race for governor between the Fort Worth Democrat and Abbott, a staunch abortion opponent. He has indicated he opposes the procedure even for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, saying, “We shouldn't discriminate against a child.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Abbott campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her memoir is being published as she trails in the polls behind Abbott, who is favored at a time when Democrats haven't elected anyone to statewide office in two decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rice University political scientist Mark Jones said he doesn't expect the revelation to lose any votes for Davis, since he said it's a relative small proportion of voters who oppose abortion in cases of severe fetal abnormality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The group that will be most bothered by her having an abortion of a baby with a severe fetal abnormality is a group that wasn't going to vote for her anyway,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The positive side of it for her is it humanizes her, and also makes it a little tricky for opponents to attack her on the abortion issue because now, it not only is a political issue for her, but it's a personal issue,” Jones said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis launched her campaign last year after rising to national prominence with her fight against tighter abortion restrictions through a filibuster in which she shared women's personal stories. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her pregnancy with Tate hasn't come up in the race, although she wrote that she considered talking about it during the filibuster when she read the story of a woman that was wrenchingly close to her own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That woman said the legislation's ban on abortion at 20 weeks would have prevented her choice on how best to proceed when her unborn baby was diagnosed with a terminal condition. Davis said she almost shared her story of Tate then, but she felt it would overshadow the day's events. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis has previously disclosed the termination of another pregnancy, a medical necessity because the egg was implanted in her fallopian tube. That ectopic pregnancy wasn't sustainable, and her doctor advised her it would be dangerous to her health to continue because it would risk rupturing her tube, she said in her memoir. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis wrote that the ending of the ectopic pregnancy “is technically considered an abortion,” and that that she also was “heartbroken” over that loss. She said she believed that she was carrying a boy, whom she and Jeff already referred to as “Baby Lucas.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In her campaign, Davis has largely couched the abortion issue in terms of women's access to health care. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story of her pregnancy with Tate, however, is a key part of her memoir. The book's dedication begins, “For my daughters, Amber and Dru and Tate, who taught me a love deeper than I believed was possible.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amber is her daughter from her first marriage and Dru, from her second, to Jeff Davis, a former City Council member. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book also is dedicated to Davis' parents, whose tumultuous relationship is detailed in the book, along with that volatility's tough impact on their children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis previously has talked about the financial strain when her father left the family and pursued his dream of a career in theater, but the book includes sometimes stark detail about those times and other parts of her life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, Davis said, her mother put her three young children in the trunk of her car in the garage, intending to get in the car herself and start the engine. She told Davis years later that she didn't want to live without her husband and didn't want to leave her children behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A neighbor dropped by and ended up praying with her, getting her past the dark spot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I've long believed in angels on earth, in a higher power, in moments when someone or something comes into your life out of the blue and saves you from the dangerous path you're on. Like that one,” Davis said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis more than once cites “angels” and talks about her faith in God in the memoir as she outlines her life story, which has come under a microscope because of its importance to her narrative in the governor's race. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The memoir adds layers of detail to her story of a hardscrabble life after her father left their family; her struggles to pay the bills as a young mother after her first marriage ended; and community college as the first step on an upward path including graduation from Harvard Law School and service on the Fort Worth City Council and in the state Senate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis previously has faced questions for suggesting she was a teen-age single mom (her first divorce wasn't final until she was 21, although she separated earlier) and for her lack of emphasis on her second husband's role in her journey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She has long cited the essential truth of her story, and the memoir includes specifics. She credits Jeff as her partner and mentor, while maintaining she would have gone through law school even without him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis also writes extensively about her relationship with her first husband and her family, including her sympathy for her mother, the stalwart caregiver, and her father, who left the family in tough financial straits when they divorced and he pursed his dream of community theater — but whom she describes as “magic,” the parent who let her know she was loved. He died last year, before she announced for governor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis ends the book with a story of a time she felt Tate said good-bye to her, when she and her husband and friends were on a golf course and Davis was caught in a cylindrical swirl of leaves, lifted by the wind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “And I felt her. I was sure of it. Tate. Moving through me, saying her good-byes to me. Letting me go,” Davis wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR pfikac@express-news.net\nPassage 2:\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, who became a national political sensation by filibustering her state's tough new restrictions on abortion, discloses in her upcoming memoir that she had an abortion in the 1990s after discovering that the fetus had a severe brain abnormality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FILE - In this Aug. 26, 2014, file photo, Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis presents her new education policy during a stop at Palo Alto College in San Antonio. Davis reveals in a new... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In \"Forgetting to be Afraid,\" Davis also writes about ending an earlier ectopic pregnancy, in which an embryo implants outside the uterus. Davis says she considered revealing the terminated pregnancies during her nearly 13-hour speech on the floor of the Texas Senate last summer — but decided against it, saying \"such an unexpected and dramatically personal confession would overshadow the events of the day.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Associated Press purchased an early copy of the book, which goes on sale Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both pregnancies happened before Davis, a state senator from Fort Worth, began her political career and after she was already a mother to two young girls. Davis catapulted to national Democratic stardom after her filibuster temporarily delayed passed of sweeping new abortion restrictions. She's now running for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to replace Republican Gov. Rick Perry next year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second pregnancy happened in 1996. Davis writes that during her second trimester she took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors first told her didn't warrant concern. But a later exam revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides, Davis says. She sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery, she writes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I could feel her little body tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do,\" Davis writes. \"She was suffering.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She goes on to say that an \"indescribable blackness followed\" the pregnancy and that the loss left her forever changed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ectopic pregnancy happened in 1994, and terminating it was considered medically necessary, Davis writes. Such pregnancies generally aren't considered viable, meaning the fetus can't survive, and they can endanger the mother's life. But Davis writes that in Texas, it's \"technically considered an abortion, and doctors have to report it as such.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis' filibuster in June 2013 set off a chaotic scene in the Texas Capitol that extended past midnight. Thousands of people watched it online, with President Barack Obama at one point tweeting, \"Something special is happening in Austin tonight.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the book, Davis recalls reading testimony during the filibuster about a woman who had had an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a terminal illness. She says the story could have been hers and writes about her hands shaking and wiping tears from her eyes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Davis' filibuster only temporarily delayed the restrictions, which passed overwhelmingly when Perry called a special legislative session. The measure requires doctors who perform abortion to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and mandates that clinics upgrade its facilities to hospital-level operating standards. A federal judge in Austin last month blocked a portion of the law that would have left Texas with only seven abortion facilities statewide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anti-abortion groups, including those that have attacked Davis' candidacy, expressed sympathy for the tough choice Davis confronted with the second terminated pregnancy but said they hoped all decisions end in choosing to continue a pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's an incredibly difficult position for anyone to find themselves in. While our heart goes out for the decision she had to make, again, still the value of life is precious,\" Texans Right to Life spokeswoman Melissa Conway said Friday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch did not return messages seeking comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood and the daughter of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards praised Davis' \"unwavering courage\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are grateful to her for sharing her story and shining a light on a subject that is too often hidden in the shadows of shame and stigma by people like Greg Abbott and his allies,\" Richards said.\n", "answers": ["Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis' new memoir is dedicated in part to daughters Amber, Dru, and Tate, and those familiar with Davis' life story might be puzzled by the last name on that list. That's because Davis is revealing for the first time that Tate is the unborn child that she and her husband aborted in the second trimester, after doctors discovered a severe brain abnormality. The San Antonio Express-News and the AP obtained advanced copies, and the news is generating headlines given that Davis shot to national fame while filibustering against an abortion bill in Texas. Davis writes that she decided to abort in 1996 after doctors said the baby would be blind, deaf, and in a vegetative state if she survived the pregnancy. Davis also felt the fetus “tremble violently\" in the womb, \"as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do.

Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to call Pittsfield Police Officer Brenna Dorr at 413-448-9700, ext 384. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PITTSFIELD — Two men are facing charges for allegedly participating in a citywide prostitution ring involving multiple women — one of whom may have been as young as 15 — who were allegedly plied with drugs and threats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joseph E. Van Wert, 65, of Becket, and Randy W. Lambach, 45, of Pittsfield, are being held on charges including human trafficking pending dangerousness hearing Nov. 29 to determine if bail should be set and in what amount. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The investigation began in the spring of 2017 after police began receiving calls and complaints regarding apparent increases in prostitution throughout the city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the activity seemed to be centered around the areas of First, Adam, North, Linden and Wahconah streets, police said. Many of the women had been recruited by a white male named \"Randy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Randy would seek out women with a drug addiction, photograph them and post advertisements online, seeking clients for sexual services, police were told. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While conducting patrols around First and Second streets, police interviewed multiple women, many of whom admitted to being prostitutes, but declined to identify who \"tricked them out.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One told police she didn't \"street-walk,\" but instead got her \"dates\" through ads on backpage.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police also began receiving reports of suspected prostitution from a North Street senior living facility, where Randy had driven at least five women to and from Van Wert's third-floor apartment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police were provided the plate number of the blue station wagon used to shuttle the women and identified Lambach as its owner. And witnesses identified Lambach via photographs as the man they knew as Randy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One woman told police she was prostituted by Lambach for about a year and had sex with him for money or to pay off a debt on multiple occasions. Lambach photographed her and placed advertisements on backpage.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Men would contact Lambach via cellphone and a date, time, location and fee would be agreed upon. Rates were typically $80 for 30 minutes or between $160 and $200 for an hour.

He would sometimes wait outside or watch from a closet or doorway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He would collect the money and keep anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of it. Sometimes he would keep all of the money and pay the woman with a few bags of heroin or some crack cocaine instead.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He allegedly recruited and transported about 10 other women in a similar manner and provided narcotics to those that used drugs to get them high before having sex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lambach allegedly threatened to turn the women in if they stopped working for him, and warned them the police would not believe them because they were, \"drug addicts and whores.\" Police were told some of the women Lambach had recruited used to be his foster children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He would host meetings between women and customers at Van Wert's apartment.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nPieces of flint tools dropped more than 4,300 years ago on the floor of a house as old as Stonehenge have been laid bare on the edge of Marden Henge, a giant ditch and bank enclosure so buried in rich Wiltshire farmland that it has almost vanished from view. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’ve over-fetishised Stonehenge for far too long, because those giant trilithons are just so damn impressive,” said Dr Jim Leary, director of this summer’s excavation with the Reading University archaeology summer school, in the lush Vale of Pewsey. “It could well be that this was really where it was at in the Neolithic.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rectangular building will welcome visitors next weekend for an open day which is part of the national festival of archaeology. The house, believed to be one of the best preserved from the period ever found in the UK, and made to look smarter with tonnes of white chalk brought from miles away and stamped into a kind of plaster, is as neatly levelled and regular as the nearby postwar bungalows built on top of part of the henge bank. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The house and other parts of the huge site have already produced finds including beautifully worked flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery including some pieces with the residue of the last meals cooked in them, shale and copper bracelets and a beautiful little Roman brooch – and the tiny jawbone of a vole. Analysis of the mass of seeds and charred grains recovered will reveal what the people were growing and eating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest Some of the flint arrowheads discovered at the site Photograph: Kevin Standage NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pig bones – probably the remains of at least 13 animals, food for hundreds of people – and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit suggest the house was never a permanent residence but connected with great gatherings for feasts. When it was abandoned the entire site, pig bones and all, was cleaned and neatly covered with earth, so it would never be used again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The structure originally stood on a terrace overlooking a mound, within a small earth-banked circle, in turn part of the enormous Marden Henge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Leary, joined by archaeology students, professionals and amateurs from all over the world, who will continue working on the site for years to come, is peeling back the layers of a monument that was once one of the biggest and most impressive in Britain. Ramparts three metres high enclosed a vast space of 15 hectares, far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Leary believes the purpose must have been status, showing off wealth and power in the ability to mobilise a massive workforce. “Avebury had the huge ditches, Stonehenge upped the ante with the massive trilothons, Marden had this enormous enclosure.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The site is so vast that it takes Leary and fellow director Amanda Clarke 40 minutes to walk from the team working on the house to the diggers who have uncovered a previously unrecorded Roman complex including the foundations of an impressive barn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like the Durrington Walls henge a few miles downstream, and Stonehenge itself, Marden was linked to the river Avon by a navigable flow, now a sedge- and nettle-choked stream, which forms one side of the henge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Avebury in one direction and Stonehenge in the other have been excavated and studied for centuries because the preservation of the monuments on chalk is so much better. Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valleys because the land is so good the monuments have often been ploughed out above ground – but it is a key part of understanding the story.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Marden’s banks, cut through by later roads or lying under modern farm buildings, grazing cows and ripening crops in many places, once stood three metres tall, towering over an equally deep ditch. The outer ring enclosed a complex of smaller monuments, including the Hatfield Barrow, which was once 15 metres tall, and now survives only as a 15cm ripple in the field. It was excavated in 1807 and, after a collapse caused by the shaft, later completely levelled by the farmer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The site welcomes visitors every day, but the open day will have finds on display, tours and activities.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BP faces opposition from some shareholders for handing Chief Executive Bob Dudley a 20 percent increase in his total remuneration package for 2015 to $19.6 million. It may seem hard to square that amount with BP’s $5.2 billion loss last year, and the fact that it is slashing thousands of jobs in response to falling oil prices. But that’s actually the point. Managing an oil company when crude is trading at $100 per barrel is easy compared to the current environment. Instead, Dudley has to work harder than his predecessors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dudley, whose pay was going to a non-binding shareholder vote on April 14, has done what was needed of him. His two big challenges were to clean up the financial spill from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster and change the culture at BP, which was tainted by safety concerns and excessive risk taking. Last year the company saw the number of recorded oil spills and employee injuries both at five-year lows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He has also delivered decent returns when compared to peers. BP ranks third among the big six oil majors, which include Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell, in total shareholder returns over the last three years, according to Eikon data – even despite 2010’s rig blowout. Drawing a line under the environmental catastrophe last year by agreeing to pay up to $18.7 billion in penalties cleared the decks for the company to start rebuilding its balance sheet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Compared to counterparts, Dudley’s remuneration appears generous. Although Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden pocketed 24.2 million euros ($27.2 million) in 2014, this figure fell to 5.6 million euros last year, according to the company. Over the same period Dudley’s base salary has remained flat, with the biggest boost to his overall financial reward coming through his pension and deferred bonus shares. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mild-mannered American has had possibly the toughest job in the oil industry. His rewards look in line with that task.\nPassage 2:\nLONDON -- A leading shareholder advisory group has criticized BP PLC's decision to award its top directors their maximum bonuses for 2015, despite the company's lackluster performance, and recommended shareholders vote against the payment plans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month, BP announced that Chief Executive Bob Dudley would receive a 20% bump in his total compensation package in 2015. Though much of this increase related to U.K. reporting requirements that inflated the rise in Mr. Dudley's pension, the oil executive's cash bonus increased to $1.4 million from $1 million in 2014. His total bonus for the year, including a portion paid in deferred BP shares, amounted to $4.2 million. That was the maximum amount he was eligible to receive for the year and was up from $3 million in 2014. Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary also received 100% of his possible bonus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The awards follow a year in which the company lost $5.2 billion as oil prices plummeted. Since the start of 2016 it has announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs and has slashed spending to help manage the slump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We believe shareholders should question whether payouts were fully earned in respect of the past fiscal year relative to the company's performance,\" proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis said in a March report seen by The Wall Street Journal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BP's compensation committee awards executive bonuses based on the company's performance in a number of strategic areas, including its safety record and internal targets for operational cash flow and underlying profits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"BP executives performed strongly in a difficult environment in 2015, managing the things they could control and for which they were accountable,\" a BP spokesman said, adding that \"safety and operational risk performance was excellent and BP responded quickly and decisively to the drop in oil price.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This isn't the first time Glass Lewis has raised objections to BP's executive pay. Last year, it also recommended that shareholders reject Mr. Dudley's pay package, noting that his compensation outpaced that received by chief executives at similar-sized firms \"despite the company's relative underperformance.\" The executive's compensation was ultimately approved by around 86% of investors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BP's shareholders will vote on the matter this year at the company's annual general meeting in London on April 16, along with a host of other issues. Glass Lewis has also raised concerns about the company's proposal to reduce its notice period for calling a general meeting, but supports most of the proposals, including the re-election of Mr. Dudley and his board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Write to Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.com NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More from MarketWatch\nPassage 3:\nAngry shareholders mounted an unprecedented protest against BP on Thursday, rebelling against a 20 per cent pay rise for chief executive Bob Dudley despite the oil group making its worst ever loss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investors voted against the company’s pay decisions for the first time in living memory, with 59 per cent of proxy votes cast going against BP’s decision to pay Mr Dudley nearly $20m for 2015, a year in which the company ran up a $5.2bn loss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was the first time that a top British company was defeated over executive pay since shareholders at advertising group WPP and Xstrata, the mining company, rebelled four years ago during what was dubbed the “shareholder spring”. It left BP scrambling to win back support of some of the City’s biggest institutions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rebellion highlighted a growing trend of institutional investors and advisers around the world taking a more aggressive stance over pay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith & Nephew, the FTSE 100 medical devices group, also suffered a defeat on their remuneration report on Thursday as 53 per cent of shareholders voted against the pay package of chief executive Olivier Bohuon. Although Mr Bohuon’s overall pay fell to $5.5m in 2015 compared with $6.8m in 2014, shareholders protested because the company allowed long-term incentives to vest despite falling below initial targets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR US banks from Citigroup to Bank of America have faced pressure to toughen bonus “clawback” regimes, which put executives on the hook for future losses. A resolution demanding more details of JPMorgan’s clawback plans attracted 44 per cent support last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Dudley’s pay looked particularly out of line to shareholders because other major energy company bosses took pay cuts in 2015, a year when energy companies were hit hard by the oil price crash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to ISS Corporate Solutions in the US, the median pay of an S&P 500 energy company chief executive, excluding their pension, fell by 1.8 per cent last year after four years of increases that ranged from 4.8 to 8.2 per cent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lombard Shareholders get sniffy over Dudley’s pay City nostrils are twitching for the whiff of other corporate fat cats, writes Jonathan Guthrie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The BP vote results — which were non-binding — were announced at an occasionally mutinous annual general meeting in London, where several shareholders publicly criticised the Mr Dudley’s pay increase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Royal London Asset Management said after the vote: “The vote against the executive directors’ remuneration is extraordinary and shows a lack of discretion by BP’s board.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some investors said Dame Ann Dowling, the head of the company’s remuneration committee, would have to consider her position. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One senior corporate governance investor said: “The company has ignored warnings. They really need to get this right next time, or it could mean people will have to step down.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BP has already paid Mr Dudley, who took over as chief executive in 2010 after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, and other directors. It said after the meeting that none of the money would be paid back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company defended the pay rise, saying Mr Dudley had met or exceeded every one of the targets he had been set. Those targets related to operational and safety measures such as the amount of cash generated, the number of major projects begun on time and the amount of oil and gas that was spilled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lex Oil prices: owe you one Only higher prices will reduce crude producers’ high leverage NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Carl-Henric Svanberg, the chairman, promised to review the terms on which pay is awarded in consultation with shareholders before next year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BP blamed the falling oil price and a $9.8bn charge to settle claims related to Deepwater Horizon for its loss, among other factors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Svanberg told the meeting: “On remuneration, the shareholders’ reactions are very strong. They are seeking change in the way we should approach this in the future. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We hear you. We will sit down with our largest shareholders to make sure we understand their concerns and return to seek your support for a renewed policy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said: “Investors are sending a clear message to executives on pay. They are saying enough is enough and you have gone too far.”\nPassage 4:\nImage copyright PA Image caption Bob Dudley took over as BP chief executive in the aftermath of the fatal Gulf of Mexico oil rig explosion NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BP shareholders have rejected a pay package of almost £14m for chief executive Bob Dudley at the oil company's annual general meeting.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier on Thursday, Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London, told the BBC: \"The executives received the maximum bonuses possible in a year when [BP] made a record loss, and to us that just does not translate into very good decision-making by the board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We think it sends the wrong message. It shows that the board is out of touch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She told the BBC's Today programme that if 20%-25% of shareholders vote down the pay deal, it would force BP to \"think long and hard about their decision\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The early voting figures suggest that the opposition is even bigger that she expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Deepwater Horizon disaster forced BP to sell billions of dollars in assets to cover costs and compensation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC business editor NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Giving someone a 20% pay rise for a year's work that saw BP record its biggest ever operating loss seems perverse even by chief executive pay standards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If it's any consolation, (I doubt it will be), bosses at Exxon and Chevron got paid even more than Bob Dudley even though the value of their companies fell by more than BP. That's the bit that sticks in the craw for many. Under what circumstances don't these guys get paid a fortune? It would be fine if some years you win, some years you lose - but they never seem to lose. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We may get a rebellion of 20-30% of shareholders today but even if it was more than 50%, the board doesn't have to listen. Shareholders do have a binding vote every three years on the pay policy and formula. No use crying now, the formula that spat out £14m for Bob Dudley was approved in 2014 by 96% of shareholders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read Simon's full blog here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BP's pay policy is subject to a binding shareholder vote every three years. It was last set in 2014, meaning new proposals are due to be put forward for shareholder approval again in 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Surpassed expectations' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many experts argue that Mr Dudley is merely earning the market rate for international executives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mark Freebairn, partner at recruitment firm Odgers Berndtson, told Today: \"If Bob Dudley was to leave [BP] it would be for a competitive company and remuneration would be part of the discussion. If you operate in a global market, you have to operate on a global scale.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BP was now in a far better position than when Mr Dudley took the helm, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, BP's share price collapsed and it was forced to sell off assets worth billions of pounds to pay costs, fines and compensation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the collapse in the oil price over the past 18 months saw BP's profit tumble, and the company is axing another 3,000 jobs worldwide on top of the 4,000 cuts already announced. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokesman for BP said before the meeting at London's ExCel centre had begun that shareholders had previously backed the pay formula. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Despite the very challenging environment, BP's safety and operating performance was excellent throughout 2015... BP's performance surpassed the board's expectations on almost all of the measures that determine remuneration - and the outcome therefore reflects this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"And these clear measures derive directly from BP's remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM with over 96% of the vote,\" the spokesman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Dudley's pay package was less than that earned by some rivals in the oil and gas industry, including at Exxon and Chevron. But it was more than the award for Ben van Beurden, chief executive at Royal Dutch Shell, whose salary package fell from €24.2m (£19m) in 2014 to €5.58m last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experts point out, though, that it can be difficult to compare like-with-like. For instance, Mr van Beurden's 2014 pay involved one-off pension payments and \"tax equalisation\" measures when he moved from the UK to the Netherlands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And in 2015 Mr Dudley and Mr van Beurden received very different rewards under their long-term incentive plans, LTIPs. Shell gave its chief executive 8% of the LTIP, down from 49% in 2014. Mr Dudley's long-term bonus increased from 63.8% of maximum to 77.6%.\nPassage 5:\nA majority of BP PLC’s shareholders voted against the company’s executive pay policy, a stinging — though nonbinding — rebuke to Chief Executive Bob Dudley and his board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the company’s annual meeting Thursday, the oil giant said preliminary results showed 59% of investors voting by proxy rejected the company’s executive compensation decisions for 2015. That included a controversial 20% increase in Dudley’s total pay for the year, at a time when the company lost $5.2 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier in the day, the company also signaled in its clearest terms yet that the oil giant may have to reduce its dividend, as low oil prices continue to threaten the once-sacrosanct investor payouts across the industry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both moves heap pressure on Dudley and his board, as they try to navigate low oil prices like the rest of the industry but also contend with increasing shareholder unease. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BP BP., +0.88% BP, +0.60% Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg, speaking to investors before the vote, defended the pay package, which he said was based on “exceptional” company performance during a difficult year.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eusebio Felix was put on leave from his job for telling Peruvians last month that four suspected murderers apprehended by police were \"Pishtacos\" — the legendary killers who roam the Andes mountains extracting fat from travelers.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police initially said the gang murdered up to 60 victims and exported their fat for thousands of dollars a liter to Italian cosmetics makers. In the end, there may have been only one victim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When they announced their big find, police held a news conference and displayed what they said was human fat stored in an empty bottle of Inca Kola, the electric-yellow soft drink popular in the Andes.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on Tuesday, after weeks of doubts about the case, police in Lima, the capital, said the investigation had been botched.

Last month, top organised crime investigator Felix Murga said police had arrested four suspects who confessed to murdering up to 60 people. He said they were selling their fat for thousands of dollars a litre. But the macabre tale now appears to be nothing more than a tall story - or a big fat lie. 'Sold-on' In an extraordinary press conference, police showed two bottles of what they said was human fat and a photo of a decapitated head. Mr Murga told journalists how four suspects had confessed to gruesome murders reviving an Andean legend about the Pishtacos - mythical killers who murdered people on lonely roads to collect their fat. But two weeks later a complete lack of evidence showed the police account to be more fiction that fact. As a result Peru's chief of police, Miguel Hidalgo, announced Mr Murga would be put on indefinite leave from his job for sullying the reputation of his unit. Initial doubts were compounded when police from the region where the crimes were alleged to have taken place said they knew nothing about a gang of murderers killing people for their fat. They were only able to corroborate one of the dozens of alleged disappearances in a region where drug-trafficking and violence is rife. Mr Murga and the head of the anti-kidnapping unit had also claimed the fat was sold for thousands of dollars in the European black market supplying the cosmetics industry, but could not confirm any sales. Medical experts dismissed this theory, saying human fat had no monetary value and injecting it from one person to another would be potentially life-threatening. Some anthropologists say the police's story deliberately played on an old Peruvian myth to explain crimes which the police had failed to investigate fully. Other observers say this story was just one of many embellished or invented news stories used as a smokescreen which are intended to distract the general public from the real issues facing Peru.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then Strayed wrote a remarkably candid book about the events leading up to her hike. The success of her story has made her a respected author and a wealthy woman. However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some enthusiasts of the trail fear that in the coming years, the PCT will become crowded with so many other ‘lost souls’, seeking some answer to their troubles by hiking 30 miles a day. While the trail is certainly open to all who wish to tackle its challenges, those that choose to arrive unprepared can quickly find themselves in situations on the trail that begin to negatively affect others, as well as the trail environment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the backcountry, hikers expect each other to be mostly self-reliant and follow a standard of leave-no-trace. In town, the actions of one hiker can affect the standing of all hikers who pass through the community. An influx of inexperienced, and often careless wanderers may invariably add strain to the fragile natural and human resources on which hikers rely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Likewise even some experienced hikers are often responsible for inappropriate behavior and the resulting often sour reputation of salty hiker trash. It is important for all hikers to recognize their impact on campsites, restaurants, laundromats, stores and post offices and remember to act as ambassadors of the trail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hiking for Salvation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Latin phrase solvitur ambulando is occasionally invoked by thru-hikers. It means “it is solved by walking”, and the concept recognizes that many of life’s previously big issues can melt away when we focus simply on hiking every day. By extension, it is understandable how a multi-month thru-hike can be viewed as a life-changing, often cathartic experience. All hikers certainly finish a big a hike changed person. Hiking is an experience that affects us for life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However hikers desperate to ‘find themselves’ often embark on such a challenging journey from a mindset of ineptitude, rather than competence. This mentality of deliberate helplessness often leads to on-trail actions that can serve to endanger themselves and the trail environment, and negatively affect the experience of other hikers with whom they share the trail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the trail is certainly a place to learn and grow, setting out on a long hike deliberately unprepared, while hoping to find some ultimate redemption is an undertaking for the foolhardy. Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\nPassage 2:\nMore hikers are expected on the Pacific Crest Trail this year thanks to the movie \"Wild,\" according to the Pacific Crest Trail Association, which preserves and promotes the trail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The book \"Wild,\" which has been a best-seller for nearly two years, led to a small increase in inquiries about the trail, \"but the movie seems to have had a much bigger effect,\" said Jack Haskel, trail information specialist for the Pacific Crest Trail Association. \"This past December, compared to last year, our website traffic went up 300 percent.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Requests have also increased for permits for long-distance hikes on the trail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The PCT starts near Campo, California, outside San Diego at the Mexican border, and stretches 2,650 miles (4,264 kilometers) through California, Oregon and Washington. It ends in Washington's remote Pasayten Wilderness at the Canadian border. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the 1950s, only 3,346 people have reported hiking the entire length of the trail, but that number has been rising each year — even before the book and movie brought more attention to the trail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Haskel through-hiked the PCT in 2006, 300 people set off to walk the entire route, and about 120 completed it. In 2014, more than 1,000 hikers attempted a through-hike, and about half made it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cheryl Strayed, author of \"Wild,\" hiked 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) of the trail as she recovered from drug abuse, divorce and her mother's death. Reese Witherspoon received an Oscar nomination for best actress for her portrayal of Strayed. Laura Dern was nominated for best supporting actress as Strayed's loving, free-spirit mother. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"'Wild' is the largest media event ever for the PCT and millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both the book and film offer a realistic look at the challenges and rewards of the trek. Strayed ran out of drinking water, slogged through snow and rain, and bloodied her feet in hiking boots a size too small. She had a few frightening encounters with people she met along the way, but also experienced kinship and kindness. Ultimately the trail's serenity and natural beauty helped heal her damaged soul. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are no comprehensive statistics on female PCT hikers, but anecdotal observations suggest more women are hitting the trail, too, from fewer than 10 percent of hikers in past years to 30 percent now, Haskel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are definitely more women out hiking,\" Haskel said. \"I hear from women who are inspired by 'Wild.' And who knows what this season will bring.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hikers hoping to do the whole trail typically start in April or May and end in September, walking more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) a day for five months, with a day off now and then to recuperate and re-supply. Timing is critical: Start too early in the spring and you face flooded creeks and snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains. End too late in the season and you'll hit snow in the Northern Cascade mountains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to endurance and careful planning, long-distance hikers also need to think about money. A through-hike can easily cost $6,000, including the flight to San Diego, food for five months and gear like maps, backpack, sleeping bag and tent. \"People who head out with $3,000 often find they're running out of money,\" Haskel said. Through-hikers also typically wear out four or five pairs of trail-running shoes, which are the preferred footgear these days, rather than the boots that caused Strayed agony when she hiked the PCT in 1995. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But you don't have to hike long distances to enjoy the PCT. You can go for a few hours, a day or an overnight. The PCTA website recommends many popular, accessible options, including Mount Baden Powell near Los Angeles; Mount Rainier and Goat Rocks near Seattle; and the Cascade Locks and Bridge of the Gods near Portland, Oregon, where a scene in the movie was shot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The PCTA has also launched a campaign, with Strayed's support, using the hashtag #responsiblywild to promote safety and \"leave no trace\" practices. Those include protecting water quality, burying human waste, packing out trash and building safe campfires. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are a whole lot of people that are going to be inspired to hit the PCT because of 'Wild' and we really care about making sure that people are traveling safely,\" Haskel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And stay tuned for Hollywood's next hiking movie when \"A Walk in the Woods\" comes out later this year starring Robert Redford and Nick Nolte. If \"Wild\" touched your heart, this one may tickle your funny bone: It's based on Bill Bryson's entertaining book about two middle-aged, out-of-shape buddies attempting to walk the 2,189-mile (3,522-kilometer) Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR\nPassage 3:\nDoes the PCT have an overcrowding problem? Photo: Pete Brook NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hiking the PCT: 2016 I set out in April on a six-month trek north along the 2,650-mile trail. I'll be filing dispatches every two weeks. Follow my journey here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You can’t talk about the Pacific Crest Trail without mentioning the crowds. For the first 55 years on record, starting in 1952, the most thru-hikers to attempt the full trail, starting at the Mexican border, where I started, was 300, in 2006. But in the past decade—and particularly the last four years, since the release of Cheryl Strayed's Wild—the numbers have spiked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far, in 2016, more than 4,000 long-distance hiking permits have been issued. Not all of them are for hikers who plan to walk fully from Mexico-Canada. A few hundred of the permits will be for section-hikers taking on a 500-mile-plus trek. A few hundred more are for hikers heading out at other times of the calendar year. Still, if you look at the permit sign-up page on the Pacific Crest Trail Association’s (PCTA) website, you’ll see that throughout the eight-week-ish window (approximately mid-March to mid-May) the full quota of 50 permits per day are taken. So there’s 3,000 people attempting the Northbound thru-hike. Furthermore, a few hundred hikers will be heading Southbound between July and November. (The tougher, so-called \"SoBo\" itinerary is becoming more and more popular in the face of the hordes hiking north.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the PCTA has issued permits for many years, the current permit system—with its 50 permits per day cap—was only introduced in 2015. As a direct response to the spike in numbers, the main aim of the quota system is to spread the number of hikers out and mitigate wear on the trail and environmental damage. This is especially important in the desert environments that dominate the first 700 miles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Deserts are fragile ecosystems. They’re more susceptible to damage and when damage occurs, it lasts longer,” says U.S. Forest Service volunteer Jules Fijolek. “If damage became significant, we’d think about putting in shelters like on the Appalachian Trail. We’re actually trying to avoid that, but the idea is not off the table.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the environmental impact—degraded vegetation, establishment of new camp spots, human waste, etc—there are also real financial costs to essential services. More hikers means more helicopter evacuations and searches. Fijolek says there had already been 20 rescues by April 26. All were in the first 50 miles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s tough to put a number on exactly how many hikers use the trail during any given period. According to the PCTA, the maximum number of allowable hikers of 50 per day headed out from the Mexican border during the high season in 2015, and 2,800 long-distance permits were issued that year. Of those, approximately 1,200 made it to Canada, Fijolek says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BF1T7M0neXB NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Numbers for this year aren’t available yet—“We’re still in a data collection phase,” says Fijolek—but judging by logbooks and my own observations, we’re close to the 50-hiker-per-day capacity again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far as I can tell, the desired dispersal is working. But it may not hold up as more and more thru-hikers pile on and the only thing delineating when a permitted hiker may hit the trail is the honor system. For a long time, the hiker community, trail angels, and the PCTA were reluctant to adopt a formalized sign-up for what is essentially a wild experience. Stretching back to at least 2004, according to trail angel Donna Saufley, the trail community has been discussing increased numbers, pressures, bottlenecks, and community-led management. But sheer numbers eventually forced the adoption of the current top-down administration of permits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No one wants to envision a day when hikers are denied the opportunity to walk. The PCT is a crucible of challenge, change, reconnection, and reinvention. It’s an endeavor open to everyone: it’s call has never come with caveat or exemptions. So even the smallest of restrictions on numbers would be a blow to the spirit of the trail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Warner Springs (mile 110) I met Rusty, 71, who did the thru-hike in 2003. Every year since, he has departed from the Southern Terminus with the plan to hike as far as feels good. Sometimes Rusty makes it 100 miles, sometimes 1,000. In any case, he misses the quieter days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Sometimes, “ he said, “I’d like to hike without seeing a line of ants all the way to Canada.”\n", "answers": ["Hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail can expect to encounter harsh-but-beautiful landscapes, extreme fatigue, and—these days, at least—traffic. \"You can’t talk about the Pacific Crest Trail without mentioning the crowds,\" Pete Brook writes for Outside. He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nSINGER SCANDAL NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Jeff Herman sees a child held by their arms and legs it is, as he puts it, “an uncomfortable trigger. I have some vague memories of being very young, and there were two older girls holding me by my arms and legs, and they had cut my pants open.” The lawyer has tried to remember more, but cannot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman, 54, is mulling my question about whether he has been sexually abused. He doesn’t know for sure, he says. If he sees a child held in such a way now, it gives him “an icky feeling.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But there are other memories he will tell me about, as well as revealing that his older sister, who he asks remains unnamed, was sexually abused when a girl by their grandfather. He had known about it, although she had not told him directly until five years ago, when they sat down “with a bottle of Scotch” and talked properly. “I didn’t want to know the details,” Herman says, “shame on me. I didn’t want my image of my grandfather ruined.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman is one of America’s most high-profile and controversial lawyers of the moment. He is suing “X-Men” director Bryan Singer and three other Hollywood power-players for the alleged sexual assault of two clients. Michael Egan claims he was drugged, threatened and forcibly sodomized as a 15-year-old boy. Over the weekend, The Daily Beast exclusively reported Herman’s second suit: an anonymous British man alleges that as a teenager he was sexually assaulted—among other things—by Singer and Broadway producer Gary Goddard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The defendants strenuously deny the allegations, and say Herman is a publicity-courting grandstander, low on actual evidence, and seeking to “shake down” the accused in public. Of the second suit, Herman said: “The allegations highlight the insidious nature of child sexual abuse, which forces victims to suffer in silence. I am proud to give this brave young man a voice.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman has litigated around 800 cases involving sexual abuse, he told me. He believes in being a “voice for victims,” and he has taken on some powerful institutions: the Catholic Church, the Boy Scouts of America, and now Hollywood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, he told The Daily Beast that he had uncovered “another sex ring” there, involving agents for child actors. Directors, actors, and other industry players are also implicated, he added. He will file suits in the matter soon. But first he must see the Singer suits to their conclusion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR *** NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It feels a long way from Herman’s office in Boca Raton, Florida, to Hollywood. Herman Law is a bland office building on the side of a highway, with not much around it. In its spartan reception area are framed articles of Herman in Forbes magazine, another of an early case he won involving an abusive child-day-care worker, and a spread from People magazine about Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash; Herman had represented five men who accused Clash of underage sex abuse. (All but one of the men’s cases has been dismissed.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On his office desk is a stress-relieving baseball. On the wall is a fearsomely complicated mind-map, showing how damages’ sums can be calculated, which is really a multi-linked exposition of how abuse can damage a victim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is a “war-room” where Herman crafts cases, the rooms of other investigators researching cases with whiteboards of names I am not allowed to look at, and beside the office’s reception area, a sparsely furnished room with a little sofa with a giant soft toy on it, and alongside that a blackboard, on which is drawn a child-like image of a dinosaur. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is the “kid interview room” where Herman Law’s youngest alleged victims tell their stories. It feels airless and a little creepy, which is perhaps inevitable given its purpose: This is where children are supposed to elicit their worse secrets. “I want to empower kids, so when they give their statements, it’s a helpful, healing thing, not a scary thing,” says Herman. He encourages them to draw timelines, and instead of “freaking out” if the child says they have been touched on their genitals, he says you should ask them how they feel and what happened next. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You have to handle information in a positive way that’s going to be empowering for a child,” Herman says. “Kids love coming here and kids love coming back here,” he insists, mimicking one, ‘I want to go see my lawyer and tell him what happened, ’cause it feels so good.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman is silver-haired, thinning on top, and as brawnily compact as you’d expect from a keen school-age wrestler. He’s got four children, aged 11, 13, 17, and 18—two boys and two girls from two now-ended marriages. He grew up, comfortably and happily he says, in an upper middle-class family, in Ohio. (Well, it seemed happy: he learned of his sister’s sexual abuse later.) He always wanted to be a lawyer. His father owned a steel company, and Herman recalls one summer working in one of the steel mills. “I had to wear a respirator and double-soled boots, or they’d melt.” He smiles. “I did that for summer and thought, ‘OK, I’m going to law school.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman says he was “always the protector, always the guy looking out for the underdog,” standing up to a bully who used anti-Semitic insults against his younger brother at school (“I picked that guy up and threw him in the dumpster”), and becoming a friend and guardian to a disabled girl who was picked on. His great-grandmother’s brother was Leon Trotsky, who stayed at the family’s home in the 1920s and left with a Cleveland Indians baseball cap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman developed his own landscaping business while in high school. At law school he thought about becoming an entertainment lawyer, until he saw some of the profession at work in Los Angeles, which made him realize it didn’t interest him—now, of course, he is set dead-against the Hollywood legal establishment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman was working as a commercial litigator when, in 1997, he was asked by someone to get involved in the case of a parent whose child had been sexually abused at a school. “I was horrified. It turned out the school had hired a convicted pedophile and didn’t do a background check. It really hit home for me. The families, whose kids were autistic, had nowhere to turn: The pedophile had fled the country. The moms were devastated at not just what had happened to their kids, but that he was now out there abusing other kids.” He clearly builds a close rapport with his clients: They call him at all hours of the day and night, he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman did “a lot of learning and forensic training” and now trains investigators himself. “It felt like a life calling,” Herman says, checking himself before adding, “That sounds…whatever…but it was, and it really became so important for me that I felt like I had a responsibility to go out there and protect kids who don’t have a voice.” His practice was built on suing the Archdiocese of Miami in a raft of clergy sex-abuse cases, which reported in 2008 it had paid out $21.3 million in settlements, the majority of the money going to Herman’s clients. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet five years ago, Herman reveals, he had had enough and thought about quitting. “I couldn’t take it any more. I was feeling physically ill, hearing these stories every day. But I have to hear it.” One “really dark” case had affected him, of two toddler-brothers who had been forcibly sodomized and orally raped. “They were so helpless, it really got to me. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I thought, ‘I can’t take this. Maybe I shouldn’t be doing this any more.’ Even though it was rewarding, it became such a heavy burden.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR *** NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn’t Herman’s only difficult professional period. He was suspended from practice for 18 months in 2009, having been found to have acted “dishonestly” after investing in and ultimately controlling a company that went into business in competition with a client. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Herman shall accept no new business until he is reinstated to the practice of law in Florida,” the Florida Supreme Court wrote in its 20-page opinion of the case. Reports from the time show Herman was judged to have violated the Florida Bar’s conflict of interest rules when he started up an aviation company in the late 1990s that directly competed with a client in the same business, without disclosing it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The client, Aero Controls of Seattle, sued Herman and his law firm. After a 2005 out-of-court settlement, Aero filed an ethics complaint against Herman with the Florida Bar. ‘'His failure to disclose was dishonest and deceitful,” the judge wrote in his report. The judge recommended a three-month suspension, but the Florida Bar imposed a suspension that was six times longer, and further ordered that Herman pay $11,741 in legal costs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case has been cited by Herman’s legal opponents in the Singer suits. “It’s on the public record, and it’s all fair if they think it's relevant,” Herman says. “To try to attack my credibility, it is what it is, it’s a fact. I never denied I made an investment in a company. I didn’t think I needed a waiver, the Bar said I did. It’s obviously not relevant in court now. The defendants are trying to save their reputations, and they are entitled to do whatever they want. I don’t think it helps them. Every time I hear this pushback from defendants, I hear from more victims.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman returned to work in 2011 and tackled the sex-abuse cases with renewed zeal. He didn’t always win, most notably in representing the alleged victims of Elmo puppeteer Clash. Five men had claimed they had been sexually abused by Clash when underage, but the cases were dismissed last year because the statute of limitations had run out. One more case is still outstanding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time, Clash’s attorney said: “As we have maintained all along, our goal has been to put these spurious claims behind him, so that Kevin can go about the business of reclaiming his personal life and his professional standing…The judge’s decision to dismiss and close the three lawsuits is an important step in that direction. Kevin is looking forward to a time in the near future when he can tell his story free of innuendo and false claims.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When I mention the failure of the cases, Herman gives an unexpected response. “What do you mean I didn’t win?” he asks. “I give my clients a voice. That was a win for them. I win by filing. It’s about taking back power and control and standing up for yourself as a victim.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman says this heartily, even if it sounds absurd. Surely if a ruling goes against him, that shows—for whatever reason—that Herman’s case wasn’t strong enough. Herman still holds out hope that one more case, filed in Pennsylvania—which has a longer statute of limitations—rather than Manhattan may go the accuser’s way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unsurprisingly, working in such an emotionally charged field, Herman amasses nemeses. Marty Singer, Bryan Singer’s lawyer, has accused him of “reckless and irresponsible” conduct in the Egan case. He says he still hasn’t been served with a copy of the complaint (Herman Law says this is nothing more than an administrative matter.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Clearly, Mr. Herman doesn’t want to litigate this case,” Singer has said. “He just wants to host press conferences and issue press releases for the media. This is nothing more than an effort to ruin Bryan’s career and reputation, which he has worked so hard to establish. It’s clear that Mr. Herman is using these lawsuits as an opportunity to promote himself and his law firm.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman’s 2009 suspension, said Singer, indicated his “reputation for honesty as an attorney leaves a lot to be desired.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like Singer, the Catholic Church in Miami also criticized Herman’s parading of accusations in front of the cameras. In 2012, after a press conference in which Herman had named a pastor as the abuser of a 16-year-old boy, Mary Ross Agosta, the archdiocese’s communications director, said: “When the news media cover these Jeff Herman press conferences, they do not come away with the full truth. They are either not asking follow-up questions or Jeff Herman is not revealing any details.” She accused Herman of “manipulating the media.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is Herman a fame whore, grandstanding at these press conferences? “Is there another word for it?” he asks, askance at my use of the term. “I don’t mind it, I don’t get nervous. I make my livelihood doing this. We absolutely have to market ourselves. It’s a win-win for me.” He freely admits to being “opportunistic”; he gives the press conferences so publicly because more publicity means, he hopes, more victims coming forward, and because it brings something more fundamental into the open—the alleged abuse having been carried out in private, and the shame felt by the victim also felt acutely privately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the accusatory pressers put Herman in the position of publicly humiliating someone who has not been convicted—or even arrested—for a crime. There’s no due process to prove these men are predators; just Herman’s say-so. The lawyer doesn’t seem to countenance the possible innocence of some of the accused perpetrators he names in front of cameras. But, he insisted to me, he didn’t make accusations lightly, or to just make headlines. “The last thing I want to do is file a frivolous case,” says Herman. “It’s certainly unfair to accuse a perpetrator and it discredits other victims.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Healing, Herman, says, doesn’t begin until a victim has fully disclosed what happened to them; to that end he gently but firmly gets them to break down their movements around any incident, moment by moment. He seems to relish taking on organizations or institutions like the Catholic Church or Hollywood, I say. “The similarity in all the cases is people looking the other way because they’re scared. My message is all about making it safe for adults to protect kids.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hollywood’s silence, Herman says, works brutally simply, because people are scared for their jobs. “If you speak you get crushed.” He says he knows there are PR campaigns being waged against him, and he gets calls suggesting he might be being followed. “I say, ‘Where to?’ To my son’s lacrosse game, or my daughter’s dance recital? I’m not worried about anything.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parenthood is the most important thing to him, Herman says. He is “extraordinarily close” to his children, and tries—despite his day job—-not to be too over-protective. However, he says that that when he goes into a room he can spot a predator. “It’s a little scary sometimes. You see the way people interact with kids, there are these red flags. We all have this innate ability to sense danger.” He tells parents to go with their gut: “If someone makes them feel uncomfortable, take them out of your kid’s life. What’s worse? You insult somebody, but if you don’t you’re wrong and your kid could be abused.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Isn’t this approach in danger of seeing abuse where it doesn’t exist? Of encouraging paranoia about adults being around children? Herman shakes his head. “I’m just saying go with your gut, go with caution.” He has even produced an app, which is a quiz for adults and children, aimed at identifying likely abusers. “You should never leave your kids, below a certain age, alone with an adult male. 90 per cent of adult predators are male.” But not all males are predators: again, this sounds uncomfortably blanket and paranoid. Herman also says: “No parent wants to see their child abused,” which surprises me, because some parents do abuse their children and surely he must have seen that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR *** NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As we eat a sandwich-lunch in his office, Herman again turns to the sexual assault he has experienced more personally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “So, I was assaulted when I was in law school in a men’s room, It was the weirdest thing. In a stall.” He pauses. “When I look back and think about why I am motivated about cases, a couple of things hit home for me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another pause. “I’ve never reflected like this,” he says. He recalls that when he was 10 years old his mother told him a story about a little boy being molested in a bathroom. “He was raped. It scared the crap out of me. It was so horrific. I think she was telling me to be careful. That story stuck with me. I felt so bad for this boy, how helpless he was. And it affected me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He switches back to his own assault. He was in a mall with his mother and sister in Cleveland. It was Hallowe’en. He went to the bathroom, which was crowded. He entered a stall. Suddenly next to him, coming from under the partition, was someone’s hand. First he thought the person might have wanted to borrow some toilet paper. “I was trying to figure out what to do. The hand started to come up towards me, and scared the crap out of me. I stand up and it grabs my leg. Now I’m in shock. So I stand up on the toilet and the guy drops down on the floor and the hand is coming up to me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman left the stall and went into the bathroom’s main area. He looked at himself in the mirror, and wondered why he was afraid: “I was a big guy.” He was waiting for the man to exit the neighboring stall, feeling ever more riled, when he decided to kick the door down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The guy was sitting on the toilet with his shirt off, pants down, masturbating. I just went at him. I just beat the crap out of him, really just to teach him a lesson or whatever. I ended up bringing him out in a headlock to find the police. People were screaming because there was blood everywhere, he was begging ‘Let me go,’ and I did and he just ran off.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You know that some of the people that go to public bathrooms looking for sex are lonely, withdrawn, I say, thinking about the terror the man must have felt to have been set upon, especially in such humiliating circumstances. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Well, he grabbed me,” says Herman. “There was no question I was being assaulted. It shook me up.” I wonder if he thought about the other guy. “The perp [perpetrator]?” Herman says. “Well, not then, but I think about it now, why perps behave in the way they do. It’s sad. This wasn’t two people engaging in consensual sex. He grabbed me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As he beat the man up, Herman says his mind was on “that 10-year-old boy, who that was, I could have been that little boy, what if I was that little boy?” Herman wasn’t fired by the anger of the assault on himself, it seems. “Right, it was what happened to that little boy.” I ask if the ferocity of his violent outburst surprised him and he says yes, it did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman’s grandfather didn’t just abuse his sister, but other relatives too, Herman tells me; they formed an informal support group to help one another. A difficult conversation was the one Herman had on his sister’s behalf with their mother, whose father was responsible for the abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I understand when people are afraid to tell parents,” Herman says. “You don’t know what they know. You’re afraid of what they know, or afraid what you might tell them is hurtful for them. You either have, ‘What do you mean, you knew?’ or ‘I didn’t know, I failed to protect you.’ My only concern was to free my sister, and that happened.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As to whether Herman thinks his grandfather may have abused him, he says, “Not in my conscious memory, although I suppose anything is possible when you’re young enough. It’s enough for me that it happened to my sister. I idolized him when I was growing up. He was a bigger-than-life kind of man. When my sister told me what he did it was devastating. I had seen it so much from the outside, I really understood then how hard it was for people to accuse someone who everyone loves and respects. I didn’t want to believe it or hear it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The actual event underpinning his fragmented memory of being held by his arms and legs and having his pants cut still eludes him. “I would like to know [what happened]. I’ve tried, put some effort into trying to remember but I don’t. I think it’s important to know for people.” He has “no idea” if the fullness of the memory will ever materialize. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR *** NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman shows me a military-style gold-hued medal he gives to clients: one side says, “Tribute To Survivors From Jeff Herman,” the other “Healing Begins With Empowerment,” with a scales of justice labeled on each side, “Courage,” “Bravery,” and “Justice.” The medal seems a little weird, hokey and over-the-top, but Herman sees it as an affirmation for those who have been abused and their bravery in coming forward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His one-issue focus is, from the outside, admirable, but I ask if he ever worries a client is lying, maliciously or not. “The answer is yes. That’s the feeling I operate under when every client walks in.” This is interesting, because as much as he is a zealous advocate for victims, taking their side absolutely and shaming his accused in public, he is a lawyer first. Only a handful of his 800 or so cases have been lies, he tells me. But still: with a subject as toxic as sex abuse, every lie can result in a life poisoned. Sometimes, he says, the victims are so damaged by their experiences their testimonies are undermined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before I head into the cloying Florida heat, as we stand in the unnerving “kid interview room,” Herman tells me of a little girl who had been abused. “The perp would wake her up. She used to see monsters in the mirror, someone coming up at her from behind. Her mother had to put sheets over the mirror.” The case went to trial, the “perp” was successfully prosecuted. “Six months later, the mother told me the little girl didn’t see monsters any more.”\nPassage 2:\nDetails of alleged sexual abuse by “X-Men: Days of Future Past” director Bryan Singer and Gary Goddard have emerged in a lawsuit, filed by an anonymous British man. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Herman, the same lawyer who has filed four similar suits in the past two weeks, provided specifics and photos of both Singer and Goddard in their alleged efforts to entice the then-teenager into sexual activities — including Singer having sex with him following the 2006 premiere of “Superman Returns” in London, then apologizing the next morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attorneys for Singer and Goddard have emphatically denied the new allegations, contained in a suit seeking damages and a jury trial that was filed May 3 in federal court in Los Angeles. Both Singer and Goddard — along with Garth Ancier and David Neuman — were sued by Michael Egan last month in actions filed in federal court in Hawaii alleging that Egan had been coerced into underage sex in California and Hawaii in 1998 and 1999. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a news conference Monday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, Herman supplied three photos with the plaintiff’s face redacted — two from the premiere and one in which he was shirtless at the age of 14 along with an email allegedly from Goddard with the subject line “the closest thing that I have to a ‘naughty’ shot of you.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related UPDATE: Producer Gary Goddard Denies Anthony Edwards' Allegation of Molestation USC Students Petition to Remove Director Bryan Singer's Name From Film School NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman also supplied a notes allegedly written by Goddard which was sent with a box of Hershey’s chocolates. And he asserted that new client — identified as “John Doe No. 117,” due to his concerns about “further psychological injury” if his name is disclosed — came forward as a direct result of Egan filing his four suits and the subsequent “very aggressive denials.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Herman, the plaintiff still had the envelope in which his 2006 premiere ticket for “Superman Returns” was enclosed along with souvenirs such as a Superman bracelet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman also promised that more suits are coming and said specifically that one would involve another “sex ring” operating in Hollywood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve heard from victims about very recent claims of being sexually exploited in Hollywood,” he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bryan Singer’s lawyer Marty Singer (no relation) has asserted that both of Herman’s suits are based on “fabricated” evidence. Herman responded by asserting that it’s “untypical” for lawyers to be making such denials without any investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The pushback I’m getting reminds me of the early days of the clergy sex abuse scandal,” Herman added. “There was complete denial.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Goddard’s lawyers responded Monday with an amplied statement to what they had said on Sunday: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Garry Goddard vehemently denies the extremely serious, false and defamatory allegations made against him. And it is a sad indictment on society that when spurious claims have been made in one suit – especially where compensation is sought – other similar claims may follow. Despite the extent of uninformed and damaging commentary on the matter in the media, the allegations have not been tested in any way, let alone through the judicial process. We will not dignify these outrageous claims with anything other than a vigorous denial on behalf of our client, and by confirming that they will be fiercely defended at any trial where Mr Goddard is entirely confident that he will be fully vindicated.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman also said at the news conference that Goddard had reached out through an email to the anonymous plaintiff over the weekend after having stayed out of touch for several years. Herman said the plaintiff didn’t respond. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Herman also said the plaintiff still had the envelope in which his premiere ticket was enclosed as well as souvenir gifts from the premiere such as a Superman bracelet.\nPassage 3:\nThe Florida lawyer who publicly accused \"X-Men\" director Bryan Singer of molesting underage boys produced photos Monday showing his latest client hanging with Singer shortly before an alleged sexual assault.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - There’s not a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. There’s an iridescent dinosaur. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An illustration of a reconstruction of the iridescent dinosaur which had rainbow feathers, named Caihong juji, unearthed in China, is shown in this October 31, 2016 photo released on January 15, 2018. Courtesy Velizar Simeonovski/The Field Museum for the University of Texas at Austin/Handout via REUTERS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists on Monday announced the discovery of a crow-sized, bird-like dinosaur with colorful feathers from northeastern China that lived 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They named it Caihong, the Mandarin word for rainbow. Microscopic structures in the exquisitely preserved, nearly complete fossil unearthed in Hebei Province indicated that it boasted iridescent feathers, particularly on its head, neck and chest, with colors that shimmered and shifted in the light, like those of hummingbirds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery “suggests a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,” said evolutionary biologist Chad Eliason of the Field Museum in Chicago, one of the researchers in the study published in the journal Nature Communications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Using powerful microscopes, the scientists detected within the feathers the remnants of organelles called melanosomes responsible for pigmentation. Their shape determines the color. Caihong’s feathers had pancake-shaped melanosomes similar to those of hummingbirds with iridescent feathers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much of its body had dark feathers, but ribbon-like iridescent feathers covered its head and neck. While it possessed many bird-like characteristics, the researchers doubted it could actually get airborne. Its plumage could have attracted mates while also providing insulation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caihong was a two-legged predator with a Velociraptor-like skull and sharp teeth, probably hunting small mammals and lizards. It had crests above its eyes that looked like bony eyebrows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many dinosaurs possessed feathers. Birds evolved from small feathered dinosaurs near the end of the Jurassic Period. Caihong had fuzzy feathers and pennaceous ones, those that look like writing quills. It is the earliest-known creature with asymmetrical feathers, a trait used by birds to steer when flying. Caihong’s were on its tail, suggesting tail feathers, not arm feathers, were first utilized for aerodynamic locomotion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It is extremely similar to some early birds such as Archaeopteryx,” said paleontologist Xing Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, referring to the earliest-known bird, which lived 150 million years ago. “Its forelimbs were configured like wings. To be honest, I am not sure what function the feathers have, and I don’t think that you can completely exclude the possibility that the feathers helped the animal to get in the air.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked what someone might say upon seeing Caihong, University of Texas paleontologist Julia Clarke said, “‘Wow!’ And if they are anything like me, they might want one as a pet. Not suitable for children.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dinosaur’s full scientific name, Caihong juji, means “rainbow with a big crest.”\nPassage 2:\nSystematic palaeontology NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Theropoda Marsh, 1881 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maniraptora Gauthier, 1986 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paraves Sereno, 1998 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caihong juji gen. et sp. nov.

Caihong is from the Mandarin ‘Caihong’ (rainbow), referring to the beautiful preservation of the holotype specimen of the animal and the array of insights it offers into paravian evolution; juji is from the Mandarin ‘ju’ (big) and ‘ji’ (crest), referring to the animal’s prominent lacrimal crests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holotype. PMoL-B00175 (Paleontological Museum of Liaoning), a nearly complete skeleton with associated plumage preserved on a slab and counter slab from Gangou, Qinglong, northern Hebei Province, Tiaojishan Formation, early Late Jurassic, ~161 Myr9 (Supplementary Figs. 1–5; Supplementary Notes 1 and 2). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Diagnosis. A small theropod with the following autapomorphies within Paraves: accessory fenestra posteroventral to promaxillary fenestra, lacrimal with prominent dorsolaterally oriented crests, robust dentary with anterior tip dorsoventrally deeper than its midsection and short ilium (<50% of the femoral length, compared to considerably >50% in other theropods). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Differentia. Besides the aforementioned autapomorphies, Caihong juji further differs from the Yanliao theropods Anchiornis huxleyi, Xiaotingia zhengi, Eosinopteryx brevipenna and Aurornis xui in possessing the following features: a shallow skull with long snout (about 60% of skull length), antorbital fenestra much longer anteroposteriorly than high dorsoventrally, postorbital with extremely short squamosal process and exceedingly long jugal process, caudal vertebral series short (ie, caudal vertebral series/femur length ratio about 2.5, compared to ~4.0 in Anchiornis huxleyi and Aurornis xui; this ratio has been suggested to be 2.7 in Eosinopteryx brevipenna, but the illustrated posterior-most preserved caudal vertebrae are only slightly shorter than the mid-series caudals5 and thus are not the terminal caudals in that taxon), forelimb proportionally short (about 60% the hindlimb length, compared to about 85% in Anchiornis huxleyi, about 80% in Aurornis xui and 75% in Eosinopteryx brevipenna), forearm proportionally long (ulna and radius longer than humerus, a feature only known in relatively derived birds and in the scansoriopterygid Yi qi among theropods) and manual unguals proportionally small (eg, Manual phalanx III-3/III-2 length ratio about 0.5, compared to ~0.9 in Anchiornis huxleyi and other Tiaojishan theropods). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caihong juji further differs from Anchiornis huxleyi, Eosinopteryx brevipenna and Aurornis xui but not Xiaotingia zhengi in the following features: jugal with long and shallow quadratojugal process, ilium with a long preacetabular process (about 60% of iliac length compared to about 50% in Anchiornis huxleyi, Aurornis xui and Eosinopteryx brevipenna) and comparatively short lower segments of hindlimb (eg, tibiotarsus <120% of femoral length, compared to about 160% in Anchiornis huxleyi and about 140% in Aurornis xui and Eosinopteryx brevipenna). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caihong juji further differs Xiaotingia zhengi in the following features: the posterior maxillary ramus shallow (ie, a depth at mid-length considerably smaller than the corresponding portion of the dentary), the surangular with less extensive lateral exposure, a moderately large surangular foramen, the tooth crowns recurved and slender in lateral view, metacarpal IV less robust than metacarpals II and III; and manual phalanx III-2 shorter than metacarpal III (we identify the three manual digits of maniraptorans as II-III-IV following some recent studies7,10, rather than as I-II-III as in many other studies11), ischium with rectangular obturator process (only known in Anchiornis huxleyi, Aurornis xui, and Eosinopteryx brevipenna and Archaeopteryx among coelurosaurs), among others. Caihong juji further differs Eosinopteryx brevipenna in the following features: ilium with relatively deep postacetabular process and extensive tail feathering. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caihong juji further differs Aurornis xui in the following features: manual phalanx II-1 about the same in thickness as the radius, ilium with a convex dorsal margin, ischium with posteriorly curved distal end (compared to the unusually anteroventrally curved ischial distal end in Aurornis), and extremely short metatarsal I (<15% of the metatarsal length, compared to about 30% in Aurornis xui), among others. Caihong juji differs from Pedopenna daohugouensis in the following features: a relatively robust pedal phalanx I-1 (a length/mid-shaft-diameter ratio of about 4.0, compared to 7.2 in Pedopenna), an extremely short metatarsal I (<15% of the metatarsal III length, compared to about 25% in Pedopenna), pedal phalanx III-3 considerably longer than III-2 (III-3 slightly shorter than III-2 in Pedopenna) and extensive feathering of the pedal digits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Description and comparisons NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The holotype is assessed to be an adult based on closure of the neurocentral sutures in all preserved vertebrae. It is small (Supplementary Table 1), estimated to be ~400 mm in total skeletal body length with a body mass of ~475 g12. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cranial morphology is well exposed on the left side of the rostrum of the skull and mandible preserved on the counter slab, but poorly exposed on the slab and other parts of the skull and mandible on the counter slab (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). In order to understand better the cranial morphology, we prepare the slab from the bottom side, which reveals well most of the left side of the skull and mandible except the rostrum (Supplementary Fig. 4c). In general, the skull and mandible are well preserved, with most elements preserved in their original anatomical positions, though a few elements are slightly displaced (Fig. 1d, e). For example, the nasals are slightly inclined anteroventrally, the left palatine is slightly displaced dorsally, the left lacrimal slightly anteriorly and the braincase slightly anteriorly.

It displays five major openings from lateral view: an elongate-oval-shaped external naris that extends posteriorly beyond the anterior border of the antorbital fossa as in many other basal paravians4, a hypertrophied elliptical maxillary fenestra that is centrally located, an anteroposteriorly elongated antorbital fenestra that is ~40% of the anteroposterior length of the antorbital fossa and that appears to be extensively medially walled as in the troodontid Mei13, an orbit longer anteroposteriorly than dorsoventrally, and a relatively large infratemporal fenestra. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The premaxilla has a small prenarial portion and a nearly vertical anterior margin more common in dromaeosaurids than in troodontids and basal birds. The subnarial portion is large and longer anteroposteriorly than dorsoventrally. A slender subnarial process contacts a slender nasal subnarial process about the mid-length of the external naris to separate the external naris from the maxilla. The nasal process of the premaxilla is flattened dorsoventrally, a feature seen in troodontids and ornithomimosaurs14. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The maxilla is relatively shallow element, with the maximum height/length ratio about 0.3. It has a relatively small and high anterior ramus and a slender subantorbital-fossa ramus that has parallel dorsal and ventral margins and a robust posterior portion. There is a shallow groove along the lateral surface of the subantorbial-fossa ramus in which there are a row of anteroposteriorly-elongate, large foramina. The antorbital fossa contains a large promaxillary fenestra as in some basal paravians including Archaeopteryx4, posteroventral to which is an accessory fenestra. Both fenestrae are at least partially walled medially. The maxillary fenestra is separated from the antorbital fenestra by a narrow interfenestral bar, the posterior margin of which is scalloped in two places, indicating the posterior ends of the narial passage and a ventral canal connecting the antorbital and maxillary fenestrae as in troodontids15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The nasal is a major element contributing to the roof of the snout. It sends anteroventrally a slender subnarial process to the level of the mid-length of the external naris, which overlaps the lateral surface of the subnarial process of the premaxilla. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lacrimal is tetra-radiated, with an anterior process, a posterior process, a descending process and a fourth dorsolateral process. The anterior process is not well exposed, and thus it is not known whether the anterior process is highly elongated as in troodontids14. As in many paravians16, a posterior process is present, and furthermore, it is long as in many deinonychosaurs16. The descending process of the lacrimal has an anteroposteriorly relatively broad lateral surface and expanded ventral end. One striking feature is the presence of a fourth dorsolateral process at the junctional area of the aforementioned three processes, which extends laterally first and then curves dorsally. This process is robust and has a somewhat horned shape in lateral view, unlike the other three processes which are laminal. In many troodontids, the lacrimal extends laterally to form a horizontal shelf over the anterodorsal corner of the orbit16,17 and in the unenlagiid Austroraptor, a fourth process, which projects posterolaterally, is present lateral to a tiny posterior process18. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The frontal contributes to the dorsal border of the large orbit. Posteriorly, the frontal is arched. The internal surface of the frontal bears a prominent crista cranium along the orbital edge, which appears to be more prominent posteriorly than anteriorly. The parietal exposes little, but the posterolateral corner of the left parietal is visible. The lateral end of the transverse nuchal crest is not particularly prominent and a short and relatively broad posterolateral process is visible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The postorbital has an extremely long jugal process, which extends ventrally close to the ventral border of the orbit, and appears to have an extremely short squamosal process and a frontal process that is not strongly upturned. A prominent eminence appears present at the junction with the jugal process, but, this could be a preservation artefact. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The jugal has a very shallow but strap-like suborbital ramus, along the ventral edge of the lateral surface of which is a prominent ridge, a feature also known in some troodontids and basal dromaeosaurids. The postorbital process orients much more posteriorly than dorsally and its great length suggests a long overlapping contact with the jugal process of the postorbital. The quadratojugal process (the posterior process) is long and slender, suggesting the presence of a long contact with the quadratojugal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The quadratojugal has an extremely long jugal process, which is considerably thickened mediolaterally. The squamosal process appears to be very short, suggesting the absence of the quadratojugal-squamosal contact. There is no distinct posterior process, which is present in dromaeosaurids19. The quadrate is strongly curved, and appears to lack a large quadratojugal flange and a large lateral flange. Unusually among paravians, the dorsal end of the quadrate lies more anteriorly than the ventral end, but this might be a preservation artefact. The palatine is a large tetraradiate element. It has a distinctive pneumatic fossa on the ventral surface. Sclerotic ossicles are preserved within the orbit. They are thin plates with a sub-rectangular outline, but more details are not obtainable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dentary is a long and shallow bone, roughly triangular in lateral view as in troodontids14. The anterior end is not slightly downturned as in Sinovenator20, and the anterior portion is deep dorsoventrally, even greater in depth than the middle portion. As in troodontids and unenlagiids14,21, there is a groove on the lateral surface of the dentary, which is narrow anteriorly but much wider posteriorly. Elongated vascular foramina are located within the groove as in troodontids and unenlagiids14,15,21. In medial view, a centrally located Meckelian canal is extremely narrow and deep anteriorly, and becomes much wider posteriorly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The surangular forms more than half of the lateral surface of the posterior portion of the mandible. The anterior process of the surangular bears a groove on the lateral surface for contacting the dentary and it forms the dorsal and posterior border of the external mandibular fenestra. The angular forms the ventral border of the large external mandibular fenestra. The anterior portion of the angular is shallow and the posterior portion deep in lateral view, but it appears not to be as curved as many other deinonychosaurs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The splenial has a relatively large lateral exposure as in deinonychosaurs16 and possibly Archaeopteryx4. It has a long and shallow posterior process, which contacts the ventral margin of the prearticular and angular, and its anterior portion is not well exposed. Two ceratobranchial elements from the hyoid are preserved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caihong resembles basal troodontids and to a lesser degree basal dromaeosaurids in dental features (Supplementary Fig. 4d–h): anterior teeth are slender and closely packed, but middle and posterior teeth are more stout and sparsely spaced. Serrations are absent in the premaxilla and anterior maxilla; the more strongly recurved mid-dentary teeth have posterior serrations, and the posterior-most dentary teeth have short stout crowns with large, apically hooked serrations along both mesial and distal carina. One unusual feature shared with some basal troodontids such as Mei13 is the extremely long maxillary tooth row: the posterior-most maxillary tooth is located close to the preorbital bar, unlike most maniraptorans that have a short maxillary tooth row terminating considerably anterior to the preorbital bar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caihong has probably 10 cervical vertebrae, no more than 13 dorsal, 5 sacral and 26 caudal vertebrae (Figs. 1 and 2). The cervical centra appear to be weakly angled in lateral view as in Archaeopteryx and Anchiornis2,22. Slender cervical ribs are parallel to the cervical series and they appear to be long and overlap with neighbouring ribs (Fig. 2a). The dorsal centra are anteroposteriorly long and lack distinctive pneumatic fossae or foramina (Fig. 2b) as in basal deinonychosaurs and Archaeopteryx20. The dorsal neural spines are posteriorly expanded distally (Fig. 2b). The sacrum comprises five vertebrae, but little can be said about their morphology. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fig. 2 Photographs of the vertebral column of Caihong juji. a Posterior cervical vertebrae in dorsal view; b middle dorsal vertebrae in lateral view; c anterior caudal vertebrae in dorsal view; d middle caudal vertebrae in lateral view; e posterior caudal vertebrae in lateral view. Scale bars: 0.5 cm Full size image NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A complete caudal series comprises 26 vertebrae and it measures only 2.5 times femoral length, proportionally much shorter than those of all other Yanliao taxa2,6,23. The proportionally short bony tail is due to the relatively small size of each vertebra. As in other paravians, the anterior caudals are short and with prominent transverse processes and neural spines (Fig. 2c); more posterior ones become longer and bear smaller transverse processes and neural spines (Fig. 2d, e). The transition point, which is determined by the absence of transverse process, occurs between caudal 7 and 8. As in basal paravians20, the middle and posterior caudal vertebrae are comparatively elongate (ie, the longest caudal vertebra in the midseries is 2.3 times as long as the anterior-most caudal vertebrae). The plate-like chevrons all are short, with the first three longer dorsoventrally than wide anteroposteriorly, the next two sub-equal in length and width, and more posterior ones wider than long, a condition seen in Avialae. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As in basal troodontids and other Tiaojishan theropods, the scapula is slightly shorter than the humerus and the rectangular coracoid has a prominent coracoid tubercle and a relatively small postglenoid process (Fig. 3a). The furcula is relatively slender. Unlike oviraptorosaurs and dromaeosaurids, but as in troodontids, other Tiaojishan theropods, and some basal avialans, ossified sternum and uncinate processes are absent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fig. 3 Photographs of the pectoral girdle and limbs of Caihong juji. a Right scapula and coracoid in medial and proximal views; b right forelimb; c left manus; d left and right hind limbs. Scale bar: 1 cm in a, c, and 5 cm in b, d Full size image NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The forelimbs in Caihong measure only about 60% the hindlimb length, proportionally shorter than most other basal paravians2,23. The humerus is nearly as robust as the femur in most basal paravians (Fig. 3b), but it is proportionally shorter than in other Tiaojishan theropods and many basal paravians (eg, a humerus/femur length ratio is about 0.6, compared to about 1.0 in Anchiornis, 0.8–0.9 in other Tiaojishan theropods)24,25. However, the ulna and radius are longer than the humerus, a feature so far known only in flighted avialan taxa among theropods26. As in basal troodontids, other Tiaojishan theropods, and to a lesser degree, Archaeopteryx4, the ulna is weakly bowed and the radius is only slightly thinner than the ulna (Fig. 3b, c). The manus resembles those of other Tiaojishan theropods and to a lesser degree basal troodontids: a relatively long metacarpal II (about 40% of the metacarpal IV length), a straight and relatively robust metacarpal IV, a long phalanx II-1 (close in length to metacarpal III), a long phalanx III-2 (about 1.7 times as long as phalanx III-1), and the combined lengths of the subequally long phalanx IV-1 and IV-2 considerably smaller than IV-3 length (Fig. 3b, c; II–IV sensu Xu et al.10). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pelvis closely resembles those of other Tiaojishan theropods and Archaeopteryx4. The ilium has a preacetabular process considerably longer than the postacetabular process that is slightly downturned; the pubis is slightly curved posteriorly and it has a strongly hooked boot as in the unenlagiids; the ischium is a strap-like element that is extremely short and broad anteroposteriorly, and most unusually, it has a large rectangular obturator process, in striking contrast to nearly all coelurosaurs except Anchiornis and Archaeopteryx that have a triangular obturator process on the ischium4 (Fig. 3d). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hind limbs are highly elongated, measuring about 3.1 times the length of the dorsal series. The sub-arctometatarsalian pes has a hallux that is proportionally smaller than that of most other basal paravians and a moderately enlarged and hyperextensible second pedal digit (Fig. 3d). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Feathers are well preserved over the whole body, except for the anterior portion of the rostrum and unguals (Fig. 1a–c), but in many cases, they are too densely preserved to display both gross and fine morphological features (eg, number and general outline of feathers and details related to rachis, barbs and barbules). It is noteworthy that the preserved morphologies are not necessarily the true morphologies of these fossil feathers as preservation can alter the morphology of fossil feathers27. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caihong’s body contour feathers are proportionally longer than those of other known non-avialan theropods2,5,28. Feathers attached to the skull and neck are either long (~20 mm in length) and linear, possibly stiff (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Fig. 5) or short (~10 mm) and sinuous in preserved aspect (Fig. 4b). Relatively long feathers (~40 mm) near the chest region and other parts of the body (eg, parts of the forelimb) show sub-parallel, thick and linear barbs (Fig. 4c). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fig. 4 Feathers preserved in Caihong juji. Feathers attached to the neck: (a) pennaceous feathers and (b) down-like feather; (c) feathers attached to the chest and trunk region; (d) primary or secondary remige near the carpal joint; (e) alula; (f) pennaceous feather on the tibiotarsus; (g) anterior rectrix; (h) posterior rectrix; (i) middle rectrix; (j) close-up of barbs and barbules. Scale bars are 0.2 cm in a, b, j; 0.5 cm in d, e, f, g, h; and 1 cm in c, i, respectively. Arrows in j indicate barbules of a rectrix Full size image NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As preserved, the proximal primaries and distal secondaries are among the longest remiges (>100 mm long). These feathers are ~2.4 times as long as the humerus and have narrow rachises (Fig. 4d). While the bony forelimb is shorter than in Anchiornis, these remiges are striking more elongated than in that taxon (Fig. 3b). One unusual feature is the preservation of several slender feathers associated with the right pollex (Fig. 4e). These feathers are not completely preserved (missing the distal portions), but the preserved portions suggest that they are pennaceous. Because these feathers are similar in anatomical position to the alula in relatively derived birds, we tentatively identify them as a form of alula, although their function might not be necessarily the same as the alula in relatively derived birds. Nevertheless, similar feathers have been also reported in Microraptor, a non-avialan theropod nearly 40 million years younger than Caihong28. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Large pennaceous feathers are preserved posterior to the tibiotarsus and the metatarsus (Figs. 3d, 4f). The longest of these well exceeds any such feathers known in Eosinopteryx5, Aurornis6, and Archaeopteryx29. These feathers display well-organized vanes on either side of the extremely thin rachis, which are formed by densely spaced parallel barbs (eg, four barbs in a length of 0.6 mm close to the tip of a feather attaching to the mid-length of the tibiotarsus). In some cases, pennaceous barbules are visible in these feathers (Fig. 4j), which are inferred to be present but have rarely been preserved in other non-avialan theropod fossils30. The tibial feathers have barbs with an angle of about 25 degrees to the rachis, forming nearly symmetrical vanes on either side of the rachis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Small, distally deflected feathers are also preserved anterior to the proximal tibiotarsus, metatarsus, and on the pedal digits (Fig. 3d). The closed vanes are not obvious in most metatarsal and arm feathers. Instead, most preserved metatarsal feathers display densely spaced parallel barbs with nearly same orientation, so are the arm feathers including those that are identified as remiges (Fig. 3b, d). However, several arm feathers show densely spaced parallel barbs orienting in opposite directions on either side of the rachis, suggesting that these feathers are pennaceous (Fig. 4d), and so are several metatarsal feathers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hindlimb feathering (Fig. 3d) of Caihong juji is seen in Anchiornis huxleyi, and other Tiaojishan theropods2,31. The new species is particularly similar to the first taxon in having extensively feathered toes2. Eosinopteryx brevipenna has been suggested to have reduced tail and hindlimb plumages, but specimens of Anchiornis huxleyi display variable plumages in terms of not only feather distribution, but also feather size and shape. Some closely related Tiaojishan theropods not differentiated by osteological features may need reassessment of their taxonomic status. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Large pennaceous tail feathers (eg, 112 mm length and 16 mm width in a posterior caudal) attach to all but the most anterior caudal vertebrae, contributing to a robust and broad tail with a sub-rectangular outline (Fig. 1a–c). Feathers attaching to the most anterior caudals are less well-organized and there is no clear evidence for the presence of closed vanes. However, in some cases, closely spaced parallel barbs are visible, which suggest that these feathers may have also been pennaceous. As preserved, feathers attaching to middle and posterior caudal vertebrae are clearly pennaceous, and each caudal vertebra has approximately four associated feathers comprising rectrices and covert feathers. These feathers display well preserved closed vanes (Fig. 4g–i; Supplementary Fig. 5), which are indicated by densely spaced parallel barbs orienting in opposite directions on either side of the rachis that often results in a crossing pattern between the neighbouring feathers. In some cases, barbules are visible in these feathers. For example, some barbules preserved in a middle rectrix are up to 2 mm long and they are parallel to each other and set an acute angle to the barbs (about 15°). These rectrices are among the largest feathers preserved on this specimen. For example, one rectrix attaching to a middle caudal measures about 80 mm in length and 9 mm in maximum width, and one rectrix attaching to the second last caudal measures about 110 mm long and 15 mm wide. Rachises in all these feathers are extremely thin. For example, the rachis of a rectrix attaching to the second last caudal, one of the largest rectrices, measures about 1 mm in diameter about its mid-length. The exceptionally preserved rectrices display proximodistal variation in barb density and angle from fewer higher-angled barbs to more numerous and elongate lower-angled barbs (Fig. 4i). There are four barbs within a length of about 1 mm close to the tip of a feather attaching to a middle caudal, and the same barbs from the leading vane set an angle of about 15 degrees to the rachis and those from the trailing vanes set an angle of about 25°. The posterior rectrices have larger barbs (eg, four barbs within a length of 1.8 mm close to the tip of a rectrix attaching to the second last caudal), which seem to set a larger angle with the rachis (eg, 25° for the leading barbs and 30° for the trailing barbs). Anterior and mid-series rectrices have asymmetrical vanes (eg, mid-series rectrix with the inner vane about twice as wide as the outer vane; Fig. 4g) and attach to the bony tail at a higher angle than the posterior rectrices. Vane asymmetry decreases in the posteriorly directed terminal rectrices, which show nearly symmetrical vanes (Fig. 4h). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In general, the tail feathering of Caihong resembles those of Archaeopteryx29 and the troodontid Jinfengopteryx32 in having large rectrices attaching to either side of the caudal series to form a frond-shaped tail (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs. 3, 5), a unique feature that has been suggested to represent a synapomorphy for the Avialae33. Anchiornis and other Tiaojishan theropods seem to have a similar tail feathering25, but their rectrices are smaller and more leaf-like, forming a narrower frond-shaped feathery tail. Furthermore, the available specimens of Anchiornis and its close relatives have highly variable tail feathering, with most of them displaying more plumulaceous rather than pennaceous tail feathers and some displaying more pennaceous than plumulaceous feathers. In general, the feathery tail shapes of non-avialan paravian theropods are diverse and some of them appear to have functioned as ornaments1,2,28,34,35,36,37. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several other feather morphotypes are also preserved around different regions of the body. One morphotype is represented by a series of barbs joined basally to form a simply branching structure without rachis (Fig. 4b), which is also seen the dromaeosaurid Sinornithosaurus38. However, some recent studies suggest that this morphotype might represent a derived condition within birds39 and its presence in non-avialan theropods might be a preservation artefact27. A variation of this morphotype is that the barbs are stiff rather than soft, and nearly parallel to each other for most of their length, and also much longer and thicker than the former (Fig. 4a). The other morphotype is represented by a series of long and narrow feathers preserved over the humerus (Fig. 4c). They can be up to at least 45 mm in length but only about 1.5 mm in width. These feathers are composed of an extremely narrow membrane-like leading vane, a rachis that is about 0.3 mm wide (even wider than the leading vane), and a trailing vane that seems to be open with very long barbs attaching to the rachis at a very small angle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Given the available information on the plumages of basal paravians40, it is difficult to draw a conclusion whether rectrices with asymmetrical vanes and/or coverts on the tail represent synapomorphies for the Avialae or a more inclusive clade or independently evolved features in early paravian evolution. Alula seems to be absent in several basal birds such as Archaeopteryx and Confuciuornis, and thus even if the small feathers associated with the pollex of Caihong juji and Micororaptor can be confirmed as a form of alula, they must have been independently evolved several times early in paravian evolution given the patchy distribution of this feature among early paravian theropods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nanostructures and inference of plumage colour in the Caihong juji holotype NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging was used to characterize 2460 structures from 66 samples of feathers from across the body (Fig. 5a–d; Supplementary Figs. 6, 7). Cross-sectional focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM images reveal distinct differences between known fossil bacteria and the nanostructures in Caihong (Supplementary Figs. 8, 9). SEM data show that the nanostructures recovered from fossil feathers are comparable in size and shape to extant avian melanosomes. Focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy data show that these structures are solid (ie, uniformly electron-dense; Supplementary Figs. 8, 9). Because bacteria are expected to be electron lucent in the core (‘hollow’; see Supplementary Fig. 9 with reproduced Fig. 7c from ref. 41), these data (the electron-dense cores) as well as absence of any observed evidence of binary fission, do not support a microbial hypothesis for the origin of these nanostructures but do support melanosome identity (Methods).The nanostructures from Caihong were compared to an expanded melanosome data set for extant birds (Figs. 5e–h, 6; Methods; Supplementary Tables 2–4; Supplementary Figs. 10–12). Analysis of the structures from Caihong indicated that this species occupies a distinct area of morphospace relative to other extinct basal paravians, including Anchiornis from the same deposits (Fig. 6a; Supplementary Figs. 12, 13). Rarefaction analyses indicate the structures observed in pinnate feathers of basal paravians are likely to be as diverse as extant bird melanosomes, although this predicted variation is estimated to not yet be fully sampled (Supplementary Figs. 12, 13).

The morphospace of the platelet-shaped structures overlaps that associated with iridescent colours of vivid, highly variable hues in hummingbirds and swifts (Figs. 5e–g, 6b)42,43,44, but also with grey and black colours in penguins45. However, unlike melanosomes in those penguin grey or black feathers, the structures in the 21 samples from the fossil appear aligned in sheets and dorsoventrally compressed (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. 7). This organization was further confirmed in SEM images taken on a rotating stage at three different angles to the preserved structures (Supplementary Fig. 8). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other specimens from the same deposits (eg, Anchiornis) do not show similar platelet morphologies or organization (Supplementary Fig. 14)25,34, platelet-shaped nanostructures in Caihong occur only in certain body regions (Supplementary Figs. 6, 7), and nanostructures in nearby regions were statistically more similar to each other than more distantly related anatomical areas (Mantel test r = 0.16, p = 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 15). Thus, flattening of the nanostructures by compaction during burial is considered unlikely. While melanosomes from internal organs can also fossilize, our sampling was limited to feathers, and we did not observe any ‘halo’ around the body cavity that may be diagnostic of internal melanosome migration46. We also modelled the effect of taphonomic shrinkage47 (Methods). In most cases, our results were not affected by this taphonomic bias (Supplementary Tables 3, 4; Supplementary Fig. 12). If this occurred, the original sizes of these structures in the 21 regions would overlap even more of the iridescent hummingbird melanosome morphospace (Supplementary Figs. 16, 17).\nPassage 3:\nView Images An artist's depiction of Caihong juji, a species of theropod dinosaur that lived 160 million years ago in what's now northeastern China. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Illustration by Velizar Simeonovski, The Field Museum NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A new dinosaur discovered in China had feathers that may have glittered with the colors of the rainbow. Based on its stunningly preserved remains, scientists say the dinosaur’s head and chest seem to have been covered with iridescent feathers akin to those on modern hummingbirds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The flashy display may have provided a social or sexual cue, like modern peacock tails. The dinosaur also has a bird-like body, including the sorts of feathers required for flight, but it has a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dinosaurs 101 They ruled the Earth for more than 160 million years, but much about how dinosaurs lived and died remains a mystery. See what we know and don't know about the age of dinos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Given these traits, the ancient animal has been named Caihong juji—Mandarin for “rainbow with the big crest”—the team reports today in the journal Nature Communications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caihong lived in forests and may have glided from tree to tree, preying on small mammals and lizards, says study co-author Xing Xu, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In life, the duck-size carnivore would’ve weighed roughly a pound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was shocked by its beautifully preserved feathers, even though I had seen many feathered dinosaur fossils previously,” adds Xu.

Dinosaur fossils suggest that feathers originally evolved for display, only later taking on the traits needed for flight. (Learn more about how feathers evolved.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like modern and ancient birds, dinosaurs likely had color vision and took advantage of it with striking, feathery displays. In exceptional cases, scientists can reveal dinosaur feathers’ original colors by finding vestiges of pigment sacs called melanosomes within fossilized plumes. (See the full-body coloration of the feathered dinosaur Anchiornis.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yang Jan, a local farmer, found the Caihong fossil in northeastern China’s Hebei Province. In February 2014, the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning acquired the fossil from Jan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When scientists led by Dongyu Hu, a paleontologist at China’s Shenyang Normal University, examined the fossil, they found that its well-preserved remnants contained traces of pigment in its feathers. The team sampled 66 sites across the fossil, comparing the melanosomes they saw with melanosomes from modern bird feathers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Caihong’s head, chest, and parts of its tail, the researchers saw melanosomes that were long, flat, and organized into sheets. These patterns most closely match the melanosomes in the iridescent throat feathers of hummingbirds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In hummingbirds, similar structures split light like a prism, creating a metallic sheen that changes color with the viewing angle. The team couldn’t reconstruct the dinosaur feathers’ exact colors, but they suspect that the observed pigments gave Caihong a rainbow glimmer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR See Hummingbirds Fly, Shake, Drink in Amazing Slow Motion They move so fast that human eyes see only a hovering spot of color, a blur of wings. But when frozen in time by high-speed cameras, hummingbirds yield their secrets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Paleontologists have seen this sparkle in dinosaurs before. In 2012, scientists found evidence that the feathered dinosaur Microraptor glinted blue in the sun like modern crows and grackles. Unlike Caihong, though, Microraptor was iridescent all over—and it is much younger: Microraptor lived a full 40 million years after Caihong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When we put these data on the evolutionary tree, we recognize two different ways of creating iridescent color in small raptor dinosaurs before the origin of birds,” says Julia Clarke, a paleontologist at the University of Texas at Austin who coauthored the Caihong and Microraptor studies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More Than a Light Show NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caihong may not have used just its feathers for showing off, notes University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte, who reviewed the study before publication. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Its plumage was a shiny rainbow of iridescent colors … but it didn't stop there,” he says. “It also had a funky crest of bone sticking up in front of its eyes, which was probably a display structure as well.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR View Images The skull of Caihong juji. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photograph by The Field Museum NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, Xu says that Caihong’s frond-like tail has asymmetrical feathers, and their short, stiff leading edges would have borne the aerodynamic load of flight. Caihong is now the oldest known animal to have this key adaptation. The iconic bird-like dinosaur Archaeopteryx also has asymmetrical feathers, but it lived ten million years later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Caihong, “who knows what the functions of this large, wide tail were?” says National Geographic explorer Ryan Carney, a University of South Florida biologist who studies Archaeopteryx. “Perhaps it was held up as a dark background to provide contrast against the iridescent head during displays?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clarke, an expert on the origin of birds, says that researchers also can’t yet be sure how Caihong used its iridescent feathers, or whether males or females of the species had different plumage. For that, paleontologists can only hope for further study of the new fossil, and perhaps even more bones from Caihong and other feathered dinosaurs.\n", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government response in Libya underlined an unintended consequence of the success of uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, where protests pouring into the streets day after day forced the departure of long-serving authoritarian leaders.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crackdown in Libya has proven the bloodiest of the recent government actions, drawing criticism from the United States and European allies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In London, Foreign Minister William Hague said he had reports that heavy weapons fire and sniper units were being used against protests, organized in a half-dozen cities or more. “This is clearly unacceptable and horrifying,” he said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier in the day, thousands had returned to the courthouse in Benghazi. Idris Ahmed al-Agha, a Libyan writer reached by telephone, said the crowd had grown to more than 20,000 by midday — an account confirmed by others — with many of the people there planning to take part in funeral marches to bury dozens of people killed a day before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition Web sites reported that security forces later fired on some of the mourners. One site, Al Manara, said snipers fired from an army base that sits on the route to the cemetery, and a video posted on a Facebook page that has compiled images from the protests showed a march coming under fire, with at least one man shot in the head. Doctors have said that most of the dead have suffered gunshots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Video NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It seems that security forces in Libya do not feel there are limits on how far they can go in suppressing protests,” said Heba Morayef, a researcher for Human Rights Watch in Cairo who has been in contact with residents and doctors in Benghazi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government has viewed the situation in Benghazi as so precarious that Colonel Qaddafi sent his son, Saadi, to the eastern Libyan city last week in an attempt to mollify resentment, residents said. In a speech Wednesday, the son promised reform, but his overtures were seen as condescending, several said. His whereabouts were unclear on Saturday, with some saying he was holed up in a hotel in the city, where Colonel Qaddafi’s hold on power is not as strong as in the capital, Tripoli, in the west.

Nor does Colonel Qaddafi seem to generate the loathing that President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali did in Tunisia.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But political grievances in places like Benghazi have deepened with the crackdown. Some accuse the state of deploying special forces and foreign mercenaries unable to speak Arabic to crush the protests, and the bloodshed — much of it inflicted on funeral marches — seems to have struck a chord of anger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They’re not going to go back to their homes,” said Issa Abed al-Majid Mansour, an exiled opposition leader in Oslo. “If they do, he’ll finish them off. They know the regime very well. There’s no to way to go back now. Never, never.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Libyan crackdown comes amid one of the most tumultuous moments in the Arab world in recent memory, with two longtime leaders falling in as many months and a series of Arab states facing defiant calls for change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, saved from much of the devastation visited on the rest of the country during the American-led war, a demonstration ended with gunfire for the second time in less than a week. Gunmen wearing civilian clothes fired on a group of students from the University of Sulaimaniya, wounding 12 people. Hundreds of students chanting antigovernment slogans had gathered on Saturday to demand the government apologize for the bloodshed at the earlier demonstration. The original protests were against local leaders in the semiautonomous area and echoed complaints across the region over the excessive power of long-ruling parties and corruption. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 1,000 protesters demanding Mr. Saleh’s ouster in Yemen gathered for another day in Sana, squaring off against government supporters. Some protesters shouted, “Be peaceful!” but the calls were drowned out as the two sides hurled bottles, rocks and shoes at each other. Government supporters fired at protesters; one man, his chest bloodied, was carried away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Algiers, hundreds of baton-wielding police officers pushed back demonstrators, breaking up an antigovernment protest in the downtown. Thousands paraded peacefully through Tunis to demand the country adhere to secular traditions, in one of the largest protests since Mr. Ben Ali’s fall in January; since his ouster, many exiled Islamists have returned to the country, apparently raising concerns that that they would push for religion to play a greater role in politics. The government there also signed an amnesty decree that would free prisoners convicted on grounds of politics, security or activism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The military government in Egypt took more steps toward a handover of power. State television reported that that within six months, the government would end the so-called emergency law which, for 30 years, has allowed detentions without charges or trial. The judge heading the effort to draft constitutional amendments said his panel might produce recommendations as early as Sunday, for a referendum in the coming weeks. And the government recognized the first new political party formed since the revolution, a moderate Islamist group that has sought recognition for 15 years.\nPassage 2:\nSecurity forces in Libya and Yemen fired on pro-democracy demonstrators Saturday as the two hard-line regimes struck back against the wave of protests that has already toppled autocrats in Egypt and Tunisia.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Libyans returned to the street for a fifth straight day of protests against Gadhafi, the most serious uprising in his 42-year reign, despite estimates by human rights groups of 84 deaths in the North African country _ with 35 on Friday alone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saturday's deaths, which would push the overall toll to 99, occurred when snipers fired on thousands of mourners in Benghazi, a focal point of unrest, as they attended the funerals of other protesters, a hospital official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Many of the dead and the injured are relatives of doctors here,\" he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. \"They are crying and I keep telling them to please stand up and help us.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier, special forces had attacked hundreds of demonstrators, including lawyers and judges, who were camped out in front of a courthouse in Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities also cut off the Internet across Libya, further isolating the country. Just after 2 a.m. local time in Libya, the U.S.-based Arbor Networks security company detected a total cessation of online traffic. Protesters confirmed they could not get online. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reports could not be independently confirmed. Information is tightly controlled in Libya, where journalists cannot work freely, and activists this week have posted videos on the Internet that have been an important source of images of the revolt. Other information about the protests has come from opposition activists in exile. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A female protester in Tripoli, the capital city to the west, said it was much harder to demonstrate there. Police were out in force and Gadhafi was greeted rapturously when he drove through town in a motorcade on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Throughout the Middle East, protesters for weeks have been crying out against a similar litany of injustices: repressive governments, corrupt officials and pathetic wages among them. Government responses seem to be hardening. While there was violence during the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, the government retaliation in Yemen and Libya in particular appeared to be more sustained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Yemen's capital of Sanaa, riot police opened fire on thousands of protesters, killing one anti-government demonstrator and injuring five others on a 10th day of revolt against Saleh, a key U.S. ally in fighting al-Qaida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As on other days earlier this week, protesters marching from Sanaa's university were met by police and government supporters with clubs and knives who engaged in a stone-throwing battle with the demonstrators. At one point, police fired in the air to disperse the march. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A medical official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said one man was shot in the neck and killed, raising the total death toll from Yemen protests to seven. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a meeting with civic leaders, Saleh said Yemenis have the right to express themselves peacefully and the perpetrators of the unrest were trying to seize power by fomenting instability. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The homeland is facing a foreign plot that threatens its future,\" Saleh said, without elaborating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saleh, who has been in power for three decades, has tried to blunt discontent by promising not to seek re-election when his term ends in 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he is facing a restless population, with threats from al-Qaida militants who want to oust him, a southern secessionist movement and a sporadic armed rebellion in the north. To try to quell new outbursts of dissent, Saleh also has reached out to tribal chiefs, who are a major base of support for him. So far, however, that has not changed the response in the streets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the tiny island nation of Bahrain, thousands of joyful protesters streamed back into the capital's central Pearl Square after the armed forces withdrew from the streets following two straight days of a bloody crackdown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The royal family, which was quick to use force earlier this week against demonstrators in the landmark square that has been the heart of the anti-government demonstrations, appeared to back away from further confrontation following international pressure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama discussed the situation with King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, asking him to hold those responsible for the violence accountable. He said in a statement that Bahrain must respect the \"universal rights\" of its people and embrace \"meaningful reform.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a telephone call to the crown prince, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he welcomed the government's military withdrawal and strongly supported efforts to initiate a dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The demonstrators have emulated protesters in Tunisia and Egypt by attempting to bring political change to the government in Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet _ the centerpiece of Washington's efforts to confront Iranian military influence in the region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, deputy supreme commander of the armed forces, appealed for calm and political dialogue in a brief address on state TV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As night fell, though, defiant protesters in Pearl Square erected barriers, wired a sound system, set up a makeshift medical tent and deployed lookouts to warn of approaching security forces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Protesters took over the square earlier in the week, setting up a camp with tents and placards, but they were driven out by riot police in a deadly assault Thursday that killed five people and injured more than 200. The government then clamped down on Manama by sending the tanks and other armored vehicles into the streets around the square, putting up barbed wire and establishing checkpoints to deter gatherings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Friday, army units shot at marchers streaming toward the square. More than 50 people were injured. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of the protesters were wary of Bahrain's leaders, despite the military withdrawal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Of course we don't trust them,\" said Ahmed al-Shaik, a 23-year-old civil servant. \"They will probably attack more and more, but we have no fear now.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cries against the king and his inner circle reflected a sharp escalation of the political uprising, which began with calls to weaken the Sunni monarchy's power and address claims of discrimination against the Shiite majority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Algerian police, meanwhile, thwarted a rally by thousands of pro-democracy supporters, breaking up the crowd into isolated groups to keep them from marching. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police brandishing clubs, but no firearms, weaved their way through the crowd in central Algiers, banging their shields, tackling some protesters and keeping traffic flowing through the planned march route. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A demonstrating lawmaker was hospitalized after suffering a head wound when he fell after police kicked and hit him, colleagues said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gathering, organized by the Coordination for Democratic Change in Algeria, comes a week after a similar protest, which organizers said brought an estimated 10,000 people and up to 26,000 riot police onto the streets of Algiers. Algeria has also been hit by numerous strikes over the past month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has promised to lift the state of emergency, which has been in place since early 1992 to combat a budding insurgency by Islamist extremists. The insurgency, which continues sporadically, has killed an estimated 200,000 people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bouteflika has warned, however, that a long-standing ban on protests in Algiers would remain in place, even once the state of emergency is lifted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Algeria does have many of the ingredients for a popular revolt.

She had no time for rudeness and little for those whose philosophies she could not understand, including Labour politicians and \"manky\" vegetarians. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But most of all, Clarissa Dickson Wright, who has died aged 66, was a great British eccentric who became a most unlikely television star as one half of the BBC's Two Fat Ladies partnership. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The worlds of food and television paid tribute to Dickson Wright on Monday following her death in hospital in Edinburgh, where she had been undergoing treatment since the start of the year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Producer Patricia Llewellyn, who teamed her up with Jennifer Paterson for the Fat Ladies show – in which they toured the UK in a motorcycle-sidecar – first met Dickson Wright when the cook decided to launch a one-woman campaign to get the cardoon back on to British dining tables. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The cardoon is a prickly vegetable – an edible thistle – and not immediately lovable, but wonderful when you get to know it – it couldn't have found a better champion\", said Llewellyn.

A truly fabulous woman. Worked with her many times and it was always fun, at least for me. She had a towering intellect.\" Television chef Jamie Oliver added: \"She was always entertaining to watch and was of course a passionate foodie.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baptised Clarissa Theresa Philomena Aileen Mary Josephine Agnes Elsie Trilby Louise Esmerelda, Dickson Wright grew up in north London. Her father, Arthur, was a brilliant surgeon and food lover – pigeons were flown in from Cairo for the Dickson Wright table and caviar was frequently on the menu. But he was also a violent alcoholic who beat Dickson Wright and her mother. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She became a barrister but after herself descending into alcoholism quit law and began working as a cook in grand homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dickson Wright was running a culinary bookshop when she was discovered by Llewellyn. She would joke that she had put on her weight without the help of junk food. \"It was all good quality,\" she said. But the Two Fat Ladies programmes attracted some criticism for the high-fat ingredients the pair loved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following her screen partner's death in 1999 aged 71, Dickson Wright appeared in other television programmes including Clarissa and the Countryman with presenter, naturalist and baronet Sir John (Johnny) Scott. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She was a champion of countryside pursuits, claiming she was prepared to go to prisonto support people's right to hunt. In 2009 she was convicted of attending hare coursing.

She was 66. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She had been ill for several months, according to Heather Holden-Brown and Elly James, her literary agents in London, who announced the death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms. Dickson Wright grew up in an affluent family, became a lawyer at 21 and an alcoholic not long after. Sobered up, she got serious about cooking in her 40s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She was writing a cooking column and running a store called Books for Cooks in London when a television producer recruited her to collude with another culinary rebel, Jennifer Paterson, on a cooking show unlike any other. “Two Fat Ladies” made its debut in 1996 on the BBC and was picked up in the United States the next year by the Food Network. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each episode opened with the pair heading to a new location to cook, Ms. Paterson steering a motorcycle while Ms. Dickson Wright rode in a sidecar, sometimes beneath the carcass of an animal bound for the dinner table. They spoke approvingly of royal mistresses, less so of vegetarians. They enjoyed imitating profound flatulence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an era of health-conscious cooking, Ms. Dickson Wright and Ms. Paterson just said no. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On lard: “Just in case you think it’s unhealthy,” Ms. Dickson Wright said, “don’t be put off by that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On bacon: “I’m told that more vegetarians relapse on bacon than any other substance.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On a lofty legume: “Always get rid of all the lentils. You would have no idea how randy it makes all the vegetarians.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On tongue: “It’s wonderful stuff, tongue. Everybody forgets about tongue.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On flavorful Indian tea: “Yes, I quite like a strong Indian myself now and again.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the proper application of butter to a cake pan: “You really want to get it well greased. Did you see ‘Last Tango in Paris’? Something like that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show led to a book in 1998, “Cooking With the Two Fat Ladies.” Reviewing it in The New York Times, Suzanne Hamlin found many of the recipes impossible to follow — at least if one wanted the promised results. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “On camera, the two hefty middle-aged women do nothing — including cooking — by the book,” Ms. Hamlin wrote. While acknowledging their appeal, she added, “Eccentricity and farce fail to be compelling in a cookbook that purports to be useful.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show ran until 1999, when Ms. Paterson died shortly after learning she had lung cancer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clarissa Dickson Wright was born Clarissa Theresa Philomena Aileen Mary Josephine Agnes Elsie Trilby Louise Esmerelda Dickson Wright on June 24, 1947, in the St. John’s Wood section of London. In her 2007 memoir, “Spilling the Beans,” she recalled the inspirations for her numerous given names, including her mother’s favorite saint, Philomena, and a woman who cooked for her family, Louise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She was the youngest child of Dr. Arthur Dickson Wright, a prominent surgeon who treated members of the royal family — and who was also, she said, abusive and an alcoholic. Her mother, the former Molly Bath, came from a wealthy Australian family. When both her parents died, Ms. Dickson received an inheritance that, she later admitted, she spent much of during her years of alcohol abuse. She quit drinking on her 40th birthday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms. Dickson Wright lived in Edinburgh. Her survivors include two sisters, Heather and June. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite her television persona, Ms. Dickson Wright was not all puns and off-color jokes.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nWhile the rest of us were popping champagne to celebrate the arrival of 2018, Seattle greeted the New Year with a 1.75 cent per ounce tax on sweetened beverages. It was needed, former Mayor Ed Murray once said, for a host of noble reasons: to reduce sugar consumption; to raise revenue for important projects like a year of “free” community college for all graduating public high school students; and, to subsidize purchases of healthy foods by low-income families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before he resigned in disgrace over multiple allegations of personal misconduct, Murray considered the soda tax one of his greatest accomplishments, a “cutting edge piece of legislation,” with Seattle setting an example for the whole nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seattle policymakers should have paid more attention to what happened in Cook County, Ill., which repealed its soda tax last year within two months after a tremendous public outcry. Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don’t raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer. Soda taxes don’t unite the city around some vague sense that everyone will be healthier—they unite diverse coalitions in opposition to them: Bernie Sanders and libertarians, labor unions, and businesses all come together to express strong opposition to these regressive, job-killing taxes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seattle’s soda tax is particularly burdensome. A case of Gatorade that cost $15.99 on December 31, 2017 now costs $26.33, an increase of more than 64 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fortunately, business managers and customers are not stupid; retailers like Costco have posted signs directing customers to locations outside city limits where shoppers can buy the product without paying the massive tax. Already, there is evidence that people are voting with their feet and buying drinks in the suburbs, depriving Seattle of the revenue it claims to need. The same thing happened to Philadelphia when it implemented a soda tax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seattle’s tax does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages. To their credit, Starbucks rejected their hometown tax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The west coast is often ground zero for politicians who pride themselves on social engineering. In fact, a study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University released on January 3, 2018 revealed that three of the top five states with the most paternalistic laws are California, Oregon, and Washington. Nanny staters have looked to Seattle to fulfill their dream of running our lives. The people of the city need to speak up and end this nightmare.\nPassage 2:\nLISTEN: Seattle's sugary drink tax nearly doubles prices at Costco Your browser does not support the audio element. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Customers are feeling the pinch of Seattle’s new Sweetened Beverage Tax. At Costco, a $15.99 case of Gatorade now costs an additional $10.34 due to the tax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A sign alerts Costco customers to the price change and also lets them know that they can go to the company’s Tukwila or Shoreline stores to buy the product without the added charge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RELATED: Does Seattle’s new beverage tax target the working class? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new tax went into affect on January 1, 2018 and tacks on 1.75 cents per ounce. It affects soda, sports drinks, kombucha, and other sugary beverages that don’t list milk as their first ingredient. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If you buy in bulk, you’re going to notice it. If you’re just buying an individual can, you probably won’t blink,” KIRO Radio’s Tom Tangney said on Monday’s edition of Tom and Curley. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because so many of Costco’s products are sold in large quantities, customers are seeing more drastic price increases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I gotta say, I like Costco’s approach to this,” KIRO Radio’s Mike Lewis said. “People should know. And they should know and they should be able to make an educated decision.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Seattle residents are upset about the tax. Some don’t want to pay more for soda and other drinks. Others think the tax is regressive, meaning it disproportionately affects low-income families. And still others question why the tax leaves out sugar-heavy beverages like many of those sold at Starbucks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Make it consistent. Apply it to every sugary drink. Apply it to fast food,” Lewis said. “If you want to actually start talking about health effects, let’s actually have a conversation about that. Let’s not go to what’s the most convenient thing and attack that.”\nPassage 3:\nDaniel Stein estimates Cook County’s sweetened beverage tax has cost his vending machine company about $75,000 so far, a figure that doesn’t even include lost sales. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Dec. 1 repeal of the penny-per-ounce tax on sugar and artificially sweetened beverages likely will cost him more before it’s all over. He’ll again have to send technicians to his 850 or so vending machines in Cook County to adjust the price of products. But Stein feels only happiness and relief that the tax that’s consumed his life for months will soon go away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t want to sound judgy but this whole thing has been kind of unfortunate. I’m just glad it’s almost over. … Closure is good,” said Stein, owner of Northbrook-based Mark Vend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wednesday’s repeal vote was a resounding victory for the beverage industry, powered by giant corporations like the Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo, that spent millions fighting the unpopular tax. But Cook County retailers and restaurants, many of whom joined forces with Big Soda in opposition, also celebrated the win after seeing sales dwindle and customers stray across county lines since the tax was implemented Aug. 2. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Obviously, our members are very pleased,” said Rob Karr, president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association. “Now the hard work for retailers begins — to win back shoppers who took their business elsewhere across county lines.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The short-term impact of the tax was felt by stores both big and small. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Costco’s nine Cook County locations saw a 34 percent decline in sales of beverages affected by the tax, said John McKay, chief operating officer of Costco’s northern division. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The chain saw a corresponding increase of 38 percent in sales of sweetened beverages in its nine stores just outside Cook County, McKay said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You’re displacing shopping from one area, you’re creating congestion in another and it’s just counterproductive,” McKay said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At Fairplay Foods in suburban Worth, sweetened beverage sales were down about 47 percent, said Rosie Regas, co-owner of the independent chain. Fairplay’s three Chicago stores saw a smaller but still significant drop in sweetened drink sales of around 27 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regas said she didn’t blame customers for shopping elsewhere; she did the same, driving from her home in Orland Park into Will County to avoid the tax. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This was a nightmare. I get it — the county needs money. But find another way,” Regas said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the hospitality industry already has been feeling the cumulative burden of various taxes, said Sam Toia, CEO of the Illinois Restaurant Association. The sweetened beverage tax did nothing but further diminish already thin profit margins, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are similar sweetened beverage taxes in other jurisdictions in the U.S. — such as Philadelphia and Berkeley, Calif. — but Cook County’s tax was unique in how mired in controversy it was leading up to and during its implementation, said John Cawley, professor of policy analysis and management at Cornell University. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, the county said the the tax would apply to purchases made with federal food stamp benefits, then reversed course after receiving further guidance from the state, Cawley noted. Such administrative gaffes created genuine confusion and the well-funded opposition benefited, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There were constant challenges that may have contributed to this fatigue. It’s not just on the county government. Millions were spent by the beverage industry and the Can the Tax Coalition to engineer this result,” Cawley said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sweetened beverage tax also triggered numerous lawsuits, some of which are still playing out in court. The Illinois Retail Merchants Association sued the county to get the tax thrown out days before it was to take effect. The court granted a restraining order to keep the tax from being imposed. Later, however, the court allowed the tax to move forward. The merchants appealed that decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The appeal of the circuit court judge’s dismissal is still pending,” said lawyer David Ruskin, who is representing the merchants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several retailers have been sued for allegedly misapplying the tax. A Schaumburg man is suing Walgreens for allegedly wrongly charging the tax on unsweetened sparkling water. The case, which seeks class-action status, is still pending, said Elizabeth Fegan, the lawyer for Vincent De Leon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Walgreens has filed a motion to dismiss, which we plan to oppose,” Fegan said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cawley, the Cornell professor, said there is a legitimate policy argument for taxing sugary food and beverages linked to obesity and diabetes because those conditions drive up health care costs for all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Groups like the American Heart Association, the Illinois Public Health Institute, the World Health Organization and the Center for Science in the Public Interest have touted the public health benefit of taxing sugar-sweetened beverages. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that argument was watered down in Cook County, where the tax also included artificially sweetened beverages and also didn’t apply to food stamp purchases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"(Taxpayers) will continue to cover the rising costs of treating the chronic diseases caused by drinking too many sugary beverages while also seeing cuts to health care services for our most vulnerable communities,\" Elissa Bassler, CEO of the Illinois Public Health Institute, said in a statement.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold. The bill was first read in February of last year and re-introduced Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local representative Marcus Riccelli co-sponsored the bill originally, and said he doesn't believe the bill will go anywhere this year or be brought up for a committee vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But after seeing the effects of the tax in Seattle, some are worried about the tax coming to Spokane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pictures from a Seattle-area Costco have sparked outrage and controversy online. The images show a case of Coke costing an extra nearly $8, and a case of Gatorade going from $16 to more than $26. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some are worried that if that tax were to come to the rest of the state, it would be bad for local businesses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I understand the reasoning behind it. It just seems like for a business like us, it's just another cost that we're trying to overcome,\" said Heather Baldwin, the lead bartender at King's Bar & Grill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baldwin says their business relies heavily on soda. \"The majority of our drinks are made with soda mix. And then we do have a lot of non-alcoholic drinking people and that's what they choose to drink.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the tax were passed statewide, it would also include a tax on syrups and powders which restaurants use to make the soda in their machines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's going to be sent downhill to us, via the retailers upping their prices and then we're going to have to up our prices,\" Baldwin said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seattle leaders say the tax is a good way to discourage people from drinking soda, which can lead to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and hypertension. Some here in Spokane agree that's a good thing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a great idea, honestly. Sugar is actually one of the worst things that we can put in our body. And so, I think it's a great idea, incorporating the same tax as alcohol,\" said Spokane resident Jason Prettyman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seattle is expected to make $15 million this year from the tax. It will be using part of the money to help fund a program that provides healthy meals for low-income families.\nPassage 5:\nMen of the West! The day may come when state or municipal governments impose a tax on sweetened beverages which functions perfectly as intended. But it is not this day! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another year, another soda tax. This one was shoved through in the city of Seattle by the municipal government. As usual, its purported intent was to improve the health and lives of residents by “modifying their behavior” and having them drink fewer sugary beverages. And it’s definitely a muscular incentive for new behavior to be sure. The price of soda has nearly doubled overnight. Seattle residents must be feeling healthier already! (CW33) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soda lovers are crying carbonated tears! Turns out, a soda tax went into affect in Seattle and people are not drinking the Kool-Aid on this one. Mega-chain Costco isn’t feeling the surge either and put in big black numbers how much the new tax is costing their customers. Not only that, they’re putting signs next to the price display that tells shoppers where they can get their fizz fix outside the city! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As noted in the article, in one of the more creative and admirable moves by a retail chain in recent memory, Costco took to changing their price signs, showing how much the beverages should cost, and then tacking on the new tax as a separate line item. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The city government appears to have been caught totally off guard by the visceral response from consumers. The majority opinion out on the streets seems to be that shoppers will be heading outside the city to shop. And considering the fact that a case of soda has now increased in price by enough to more than pay for the gas, perhaps they’ll just do all of their shopping there. Talk about behavioral modification! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CATO highlighted a Twitter thread from Scott Drenkard of the Tax Foundation, calling on these anti-sugar warriors to at least make some effort to get their story straight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “First they interview people at the Costco who are rightfully shocked at how high prices on soda and sports drinks are now (they are almost doubled).” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Then they interview a public health advocate who says ‘that’s right! We want these prices to change people’s behavior and slow sales!’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Then they talk to the consumer, ‘think you’ll change your behavior, maybe even shop somewhere else?’ And she’s like, ‘ya the Tukwila store is close enough.’ Then they ask a city council member if this will hurt local biz, who says ‘there is no data’ suggesting that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Then the SAME public health advocate says that people won’t respond to price increases, shopping elsewhere because it isn’t ‘worth their while.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You can’t have it both ways people! The tax is either big enough to elicit behavior change, which would slow sales and hurt local biz and potentially reduce calories, or it isn’t. Get your stories straight!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is yet another example of the theory of the frog in a boiling pot of water. People are used to having their taxes increased if they live in cities run by Democrats. It’s just a fact of life. And if you increase the tax slowly over time, let’s say by twenty cents per year, many of them will adapt to it. (That’s how they did it with tobacco in most places.) But if you literally double the price overnight, that horse is going to buck. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seattle hasn’t run into the same constitutional issues that the Chicago soda tax was brought down by, but the level of failure here is just as massive. The original, stated goal was to have people drink less soda, thereby improving their health. But your average consumer doesn’t enjoy being treated like a mouse in a laboratory experiment. Provide them with enough information to make an informed choice and you might achieve the desired result. But raising the price of something they want to the point where only the wealthy can afford it isn’t going to elicit any cooperation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, the underlying reason for the tax is to raise more money for the city’s coffers. Now, with shoppers heading out of town to buy soda (and probably a lot of other groceries as well), Seattle is seeing what Chicago experienced in the early days of their short-lived soda tax. People are still drinking soda, so there’s no health improvement. But they’re not buying it in the city so the hoped-for revenue surge doesn’t happen. Plus, grocery stores begin losing business, so their tax revenue contribution goes down and some of them may even have to begin laying off workers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s a win-win for liberalism! But sadly, not so much for everyone else.\n", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North Coast Journal included Martinez in a cover story featuring images of the 35 people listed as missing in Humboldt County on the California Department of Justice's website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Playing: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story titled \"The Humboldt 35: Why does Humboldt County have the highest rate of missing persons reports in the state?\" was published on Facebook on Thursday in a post that asked readers if they recognized anyone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amy Bonner O'Brien of Trinidad was the first to respond on the Facebook post and identify Martinez as a contestant on the current season of \"The Bachelor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My sister always calls me Sherlock Holmes,\" O'Brien said. \"I was just scrolling through the 35 missing people and I recognized some of them from news stories. When I got to her, I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar and I instantly thought of 'The Bachelor.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR O'Brien doesn't regularly tune into \"The Bachelor,\" but on a recent visit to see her sister they watched this season's first episode together. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The North Coast Journal reached out to the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office, who contacted Martinez over the phone and promptly removed her from the missing person's list. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"(The mother) had phone contact with Bekah via a friend on November 12th,\" said Public Information Officer Samantha Karges. \"Bekah had told her she was coming to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm and she wouldn't be able to contact her for a week or so.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On \"The Bachelor,\" Martinez got attention for her 14-year age difference with the lead Arie Luyendyk Jr. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She has been actively posting on Instagram and Twitter since she was reported missing and often posts about appearing on the show.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bekah is us listening to Bekah’s impersonation of Krystal! #TheBachelor NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her main defining aspects on the show, so far, have been that she gives great reactions to all the drama... NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the fact that at age 22, she is much, much younger than the bachelor, 36-year-old Arie Luyendyk Jr. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But apparently, the drama in Bekah's personal life is much more complicated. In November, she was reported missing by her mother in California, and is still currently listed as missing on the attorney general's website NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bizarre story unfolded after the North Coast Journal published a cover story this week called \"The Humboldt 35: Why does Humboldt County have the highest rate of missing persons reports in the state?\" It examined why Humboldt has, according to the newspaper, \"the highest per-capita rate of people reported missing in California.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The story was accompanied by a slideshow of all 35 people currently listed as missing in the county. One of them was Bekah, reported missing on Nov. 18, 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that Bekah's mother called deputies on Nov. 18 and filed a missing person's report for her daughter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mother told them she had last spoken to her daughter on Nov. 12. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Martinez told her mother that she was going to work on a marijuana farm and would see her in seven to eight days,\" officials said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheriff’s officials said they followed \"all leads\" and the proper \"procedure\" to find Bekah. They also tried to contact Bekah and people who may know her, but were not successful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Dec. 12, Bekah's mother told officials she had heard from her daughter, who said she was on her way home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, sheriff's officials said they were still unable to contact Bekah, and so did not take her off the missing persons list.\nPassage 4:\nThey have been missing since 1977, or just since last November. They range in age from 1 to 94. They are men and women, and two very small girls. The sheriff's office will not call any of them \"cold cases\" but many of their names and faces have long since slipped from public recognition. They are not the \"Humboldt Five\" profiled in the sensationalist 2016 Crime Watch Daily piece with Chris Hansen, which suggested a serial killer was somehow connected to the disappearances of five young women between 1993 and 2014 and referred to Humboldt County as \"a lonely stretch of foggy California coastline [that] some think of as a doorway to Heaven on Earth — others as a gateway to Hell.\" They are the Humboldt 35 — all of the names on the California Attorney General's database of missing persons as of Jan. 18. They are identified with mugshots or grainy photos that have been digitally aged by decades. According to Journal research, Humboldt has the highest per-capita rate of people reported missing in California. Is Humboldt County, as Hansen suggested, a black hole? The answer is complicated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To begin with, it's hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison of Humboldt to other parts of the state or other parts of the country. According to a Journal analysis of available AG data, we do have a high rate of missing persons reports. Between 2000 and 2016, we averaged 717 missing persons reports a year (both adults and children) per 100,000 residents. The statewide average? 384. It's worth noting that California has one of the most liberal standards for filing a missing persons report, with no waiting period or jurisdictional restrictions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a fallacy that it has to be 24 hours,\" says Lt. Dennis Young of the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office, adding that he thinks the AG numbers are \"askew.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We always take the report, we never delay it,\" says Sgt. Diana Freese, one of the HCSO's four detectives who work missing persons cases. \"If someone calls from Humboldt County and says someone is missing in New York, I will take the report then contact the New York office for them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is not a one-to-one ratio of reports to missing persons as some are reported missing multiple times, generating multiple reports. But most are not missing for long. Of the 313 reports filed for missing adults in Humboldt County in 2016, the vast majority were closed: 230 returned or were located, three were found dead, 15 arrested, eight were declared \"voluntary missing,\" five were marked withdrawn, one marked \"unknown\" and 51 classified as \"other,\" which includes suspicious circumstances. Of those 51 people, only one remains on the AG's website: Mitchell Hernandez, a 47-year-old man who walked out of a family member's home near Rancho Sequoia in Alderpoint the day before Thanksgiving, reportedly while carrying a .40 caliber pistol and a backpack. The backpack was found next to the Eel River near Fort Seward. Hernandez, described as possibly having mental health issues, remains missing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Humboldt County ranks sixth in the state per capita for missing children reports between 2010 and 2016. One factor that may contribute to that ranking is the high number of Humboldt County children in transitional and foster care. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), these kids are at a higher risk to be chronic runaways, with each separate incident generating its own report. It has only been mandatory for states to report runaway foster youth to law enforcement and to NCMEC since 2014, thanks to an anti-sex trafficking bill passed under the Obama administration, although the Humboldt County Department of Social Services has followed this protocol since 2000. The number of annual reports for missing children in Humboldt County has hovered in the mid-600s to upper-700s for more than a decade. From 2000 through 2016, Humboldt County saw an average of 490 missing children reports annually for every 100,000 residents compared to the state average of 280. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked whether these disproportionate numbers put Humboldt County on NCMEC's radar, Bob Lowery, the organization's vice-president, says, in short, \"No.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a bit curious as to why that might be,\" Lowery tells the Journal in a phone interview. \"It could be that the county sheriff and local police are very aggressive in accepting reports and getting them into the system. I'm not aware of any critically missing children in Humboldt County. If you dig into those number a little deeper, the reports are generally going to be runaway children.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lowery emphasizes that 378 missing children reports filed do not necessarily represent 378 separate children, as some may be chronic runaways. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Sometimes we've found when numbers are a little bit skewed there are reporting errors,\" he says. \"Children who go missing typically come back in the first few days but don't always come out of system.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both the Eureka Police Department and Humboldt County Sheriff's Office seem to agree with this assessment, saying that the majority of runaway juvenile cases are resolved within days or weeks. But according to the Journal's analysis of data available from the AG's office over the last six years, we also outpace the state average for children missing under \"unknown circumstances.\" Statewide, runaways account for about 95 percent of missing children reports, while that percentage dips to 90 in Humboldt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only two children appear on the AG's list of missing persons for Humboldt County, Jessie and Fannie Stuart, ages 2 and 1 when they disappeared along with their mother, Mary Stuart, in December of 1977. Mary, who lived on a rural homestead in Honeydew, had driven into town on Dec. 10 to buy groceries and do laundry. Neither she nor the children were ever seen again, although the family's red station wagon was found on a logging road nearby. The Humboldt County District Attorney's Office reopened the case in 2009, saying it had new leads, according to an article in the Times-Standard. Byron Stuart, Mary's husband, remains the primary suspect in the case. Neighbors describe him as violent, erratic and often armed with guns. He died in 1996 and his homestead has since been subdivided, the site of many different cannabis grow scenes in the intervening decades. Although NCMEC continues to digitally age the photographs of tiny Jessie and Fannie Stuart, investigators seem to agree that they have been long since deceased. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We never stop looking,\" says Young. \"Investigations will stall. There comes a point in time in a lot of cases where the leads just dry up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only other missing juvenile case from Humboldt County that remains on NCMEC's database is Karen Mitchell, who disappeared as a teenager from U.S. Highway 101 on Nov. 25, 1997. A poster with an age-progressed picture of Mitchell, who would now be 37, still hangs on the wall of the Eureka Police Department's lobby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the Journal began monitoring the AG's website in November of 2017, we compared several of its listings against any extra information we could find online. We were able to contact one of the reported missing — a mother and her 2-year-old daughter — via social media and ask why the Eureka Police Department had placed her on the database two months earlier. She had no idea and asked for information about how to remove the listing. We gave her contact information for the nearest law enforcement office and the listing disappeared shortly afterward. Another woman — Allison Nicole Strout — was listed as missing since May of 2016 but appears to have been active on social media the entire time. Her name was removed after she showed up in a Humboldt County Drug Task Force bust at a Eureka motel in October. These cases illustrate a small but frustrating subset of the data: Some people aren't actually missing and others just don't want to be found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Young and other law enforcement professionals emphasize that Humboldt County is a good place to disappear. It's not unusual, they say, to spend resources searching for missing adults at the behest of friends, parents or spouses only to be told by the party in question that they had cut off contact for a good reason, such as estrangement or abuse, and were laying low out of choice. Many people come to the area to work in the cannabis industry, leaving town to work on remote mountains where there is no cell phone service. They may be out of communication for weeks or months, with family members only having a vague idea of where they might be that — they drove to Eureka, are in Humboldt County, or are in the general \"Emerald Triangle\" region. These cases can be particularly hard to investigate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No one wants to cooperate with a missing persons investigation,\" says Young of cannabis-related cases. \"Many people from throughout the state, nation and world come to Humboldt County to work in the cannabis industry. They often times will not communicate with friends and family regarding their location, and/or they go off the grid for extended periods of time. Many of those individuals will return home and no one notifies law enforcement that they are no longer missing. Consequently, they remain in the data base. Some missing persons are victims of homicides with no apparent leads and lack of witness cooperation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While law enforcement pointed to the local cannabis industry as a primary reason for Humboldt County's high rates of missing adults, its worth noting that our rates are still roughly double those of the rest of the Emerald Triangle — Mendocino and Trinity counties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eureka, as the county seat, becomes the default location for many missing persons reports. Brittany Powell, a crime analyst with EPD, says her agency takes about 40 reports a month, with a total of about 500 reports filed last year. Patrol officers take the initial report and, if there is any sign of suspicious circumstances, reach out to friends and family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Most of the individuals have been located and cleared from the system,\" Powell wrote the Journal in an email. \"I would say most are found within a few days.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many people reported missing to EPD are adults who were en route to the area when they last spoke to their family, or members of the homeless population who have fallen out of touch with their loved ones and are rumored to be in the area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These reports are usually for the long-term homeless community,\" Powell says. \"Family members [sometimes after the passing of a loved one] try to get in touch with an estranged family member. A lot of the time it is not known how long the person was in Eureka, if at all. Also, the descriptions and information regarding the person are often minimal.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both EPD and the sheriff's office enter missing persons into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), but only after a certain period of investigation. (\"Once all potential leads have been exhausted,\" according to Young.) NamUs, a federal database of missing persons and unidentified bodies, connects each case with a caseworker who compares it against reports, looks for patterns and collaborates with families and local law enforcement. NamUs' website includes several Humboldt County area reports that don't appear on the Attorney General's website. This is not uncommon, according to NamUs' founder and Director Todd Matthews, who says the patchwork of information available through local and state organizations doesn't offer the full picture that a national registry might. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't know what I don't know,\" says Matthews, who has been advocating for legislation to mandate all law enforcement agencies put missing persons reports into the national database. \"I don't know why it isn't standardized. It might be a money thing but I say, we've already paid for it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The NamUs system allows family members to submit DNA samples to its database for comparison against unidentified bodies (there are no unidentified bodies currently in the system for Humboldt County), and to also contact NamUs caseworkers to update information, refining descriptions and adding photographs. One of the names that appears on the NamUs website but not on the AG's list, Cody Conoboy, has been positively matched to a DNA sample. Conoboy, 15, was swept into the Trinity River after jumping out of a stolen car near Hoopa in January of 2011. A jawbone found the following September was positively identified Conoboy's in 2013. It's not uncommon for these cases to remain on the database, according to Young. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Some of the people we will never be able to remove from the system,\" he says. \"Maybe they were washed out to sea [in] a witnessed event but their bodies were not recovered.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Young says Conoboy's listing probably remains because the U.S. Department of Justice only removes a person whose body part has been recovered if the part is something they \"can no longer live without,\" such as a skull. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another case that remains on the NamUs database belongs to Claire Louise Christie, who was reported by her husband as lost at sea in 1977. That case gained new significance in 2010 when her husband, Ernest Samuel Christie Jr., was posthumously identified as the perpetrator of the 1988 torture and murder of Lysandra Marie Turpin. Christie was also implicated in the torture of several other women who, according to an interview with HCSO detective Steve Quenell in the Times-Standard, he would pick up in Eureka's Old Town and take back to his home in Fieldbrook. One was allegedly brought aboard Christie's fishing boat, where he duct taped her wrists and said she wouldn't be coming back. (She escaped.) Claire Louise Christie's fate may never be known. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Matthews says instances of people going missing for an extended period of time without something bad having happened are rare, although it does happen to the mentally ill and destitute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I know a guy who recently lost his cell phone because he couldn't pay for it,\" he says, adding that along with poverty, a lack of family or community can play a role in whether someone is declared missing or eventually found. \"The biggest discrimination that exists is whether someone is expecting you to show up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many families who were expecting loved ones to call or return home from Humboldt County only to have them go missing find the process of searching for them to be frustrating. Vikki Joseph, whose brother Jeff Joseph disappeared in June of 2014, says that she has found community with other families whose loved ones disappeared, many of whom, like Jeff, were involved in the cannabis industry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's hard to connect with anyone who understands what it's like to have a missing family member up there,\" Vikki Joseph says. Since Jeff went missing, she has corresponded with the families of Danielle Bertolini, Sheila Franks and Chris Giauque, all of whom disappeared under suspicious circumstances related to the cannabis industry. (Bertolini's remains were found in 2015.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Joseph, a dispensary owner from Los Angeles, was visiting his farm near Weitchpec when he suddenly stopped returning calls from his sister and girlfriend. His cell phone last pinged off a tower near Bloody Camp Road near Hoopa. Vikki Joseph believes her brother was murdered in connection with his cannabis grow and says his partners were not cooperative with the sheriff's investigation, nor would they let his family access the property to gather Jeff's belongings. The partners allegedly told her brother and uncle that if they crossed the gate, they would be shot. She found their refusal to cooperate with her family or help investigators suspicious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Where I live is very suburban, it's not forest, it's not remote, we don't lose cell phone service,\" she says in a phone interview. \"It can be very dangerous. When you mix growing big amounts of weed and lots of money, it's a recipe for disaster.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trying to keep her brother's name in the public eye and communicate with investigators from so far away has been challenging. While segments like the Crime Watch Daily piece keep a laser focus on photogenic young women, little attention has been given to Jeff Joseph's case outside of local news sites like Redheaded Blackbelt and it remains unsolved four years later. But you won't find Jeff's case on the AG's listings for Humboldt County. Because Vikki Joseph made the report in Los Angeles, that's where the case is listed. She says she worked closely with Humboldt County Sheriff's Office detective Todd Fulton but received no notice when he retired, finding out only three months later that the case had bounced to a different detective. Vikki Joseph has ended up doing a lot of investigative work herself, tracking down leads and hiring private investigators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sheriff's office wouldn't comment on the specifics of the case, stating it was an open investigation, but Freese says if they had a new lead, they would work it. In general terms, Freese says that if they had enough probable cause to cross a locked gate, they would request a warrant and do so. In the case of Jeff Joseph, she says, there's a lot she just can't share. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've done extensive work on it,\" she says, adding that it's imperative for family members to keep in contact with the department and encourage others who might have information to come forward. \"I think they should call over to our department and see who is carrying the case. Often it's going to be a family member, what they forgot to say or didn't think of [that helps]. I am all about having family members call. Sometimes I will set up a day, every week or every month. I say, 'I will call you at 9 o'clock,' and update them on where we're at. That can bring some peace.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vikki Joseph isn't satisfied. She describes herself as being in a double-bind, with plenty of information but a frustrating lack of options for what to do with it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have things other families don't have,\" she says. \"Things that could have all been researched. But there's only so much we can do. I can research it and research it, can provide them with all their leads and tips but I can't arrest anyone.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although Jeff Joseph was originally listed as \"voluntary missing,\" Vikki Joseph doesn't believe her brother would have disappeared on purpose. He was a loving, kind man, she insists. He was non-violent, refusing to carry a gun. When their mother was dying, Jeff was the one who took care of her, feeding her and changing her diapers. He would never go this long without letting his family know he was OK. It hurts Vikki Joseph to think about what he must have felt in those last moments, the fear and betrayal. She just wants to know where his body is to bring him back to Los Angeles County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked what she's going to do once that happens, Vikki Joseph doesn't hesitate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm going to put him to rest next to his mom,\" she says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Journal graphic designer Jonathan Webster contributed to this report.

The San Francisco Chronicle reports a 22-year-old woman reported missing in November in California was found this week—because she's a current contestant on The Bachelor. The strange story started when Bekah Martinez's mom reported her missing to the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office on Nov. 18. According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people. That list was the basis for a story in the North Coast Journal about the high number of missing people in Humboldt County. The newspaper shared the story Thursday on Facebook and asked readers if they recognized any of the missing people. Amy O'Brien did. \"I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar,\" O'Brien tells the Chronicle. \"I instantly thought of The Bachelor.\" The Journal informed the sheriff's office, which contacted Martinez and removed her from the list. \"MOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don’t get cell service on The Bachelor??,\" Martinez tweeted after learning she was a missing person.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nAccording to the New York Post and People.com, Nicole “Snooki” Pollizzi, is, despite her protestations, pregnant with her first child. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Jersey Shore star is roughly three months pregnant, and the baby’s father is her boyfriend, Jionni LaValle, according to the paper, which also notes that as recently as Feb. 2, the diminutive reality star went on ABC’s Good Morning America and shot down stories about her being in a family way.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Snooki isn’t an outlier in her baby mama drama. Pollizi, who recently began filming a reality spin-off of the Jersey Shore with costar and friend Jenni Farley in my hometown of Jersey City, NJ, is experiencing what millions of single American women will go through this year: the weighty iron wrench that a bambino throws into even the best-laid plans for life, career, relationships, you name it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to recent reporting in the NYTimes, the fastest-growing group of new moms are young, single women. “More than half of births to American women under 30 occur outside marriage,” Sabrina Tavernise writes, “It used to be called illegitimacy. Now it is the new normal.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Only in Snooki’s case, we get to watch it play out in the tabloids. And in terms of her career, it’s a much bigger, heavier and potentially more destructive wrench. See, the 4’9” star has built her name upon her Jersey Shore antics—skipping work, flashing her panties, getting arrested—most often with the lubrication of liquor. She’s lined her pockets with endorsement deals for energy drinks and diet pills—definite no-no’s for a mommy-to-be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would be easy to say that Snooki’s troubles—should this baby turn out to be true—are worlds away from those of your run-of-the-mill (read: non reality star) pregnant 24-year-old. But the truth is that her issues are just heightened versions of the same. Will she be able to provide for her child? Likely, although it depends on whether she’s hired a real-deal wealth manager or if she’s squandering her $100K an episode on leopard print and spray tans. Will her career plans survive this unexpected baby-bump in the road? If she can convince producers that her labor should be televised, then maybe. And in the end, will Snooki be a good mother? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the premise of the new series, rumored to be titled “Snooki and JWoww v. The World,” is still unknown, it’s easy to imagine producers thought it would follow suit: on the pair’s first weekend in Jersey City they celebrated Jenni “JWoww” Farley’s 26th birthday at O’Connell’s Bar by renting out a full floor for partying. For her part, Polizzi’s told the press that it won’t be all vodka and club-hopping this season. “We want it to be different than ‘Jersey Shore,’ so it’s not always going to the club, drinking and partying,” she told US Weekly. “It’s the first time I’m going to be on my own for real.

Reps for both Polizzi and 495 Productions, which produces the show in addition to Jersey Shore, did not respond to phonecalls, but given the delayed production schedule, it’s worth speculating that it was Snooki’s big news that slowed things down, not the conflicts over locations that were fed to the press.

For other uses, see FASD (disambiguation) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy.[1] Problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, and problems with hearing or seeing.[1][2] Those affected are more likely to have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and have trouble with alcohol or other drugs.[7] The most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).[1] Other types include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).[1][8] Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.[9] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy.[1] Surveys from the United States have found about 10% of pregnant women have drunk alcohol in the last month, and 20% to 30% drank at some point during the pregnancy.[10] About 4.7% of North American women who are pregnant are alcoholics.[11] The risk of problems depends on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption as well as when during pregnancy the alcohol is consumed.[10] Other risk factors include an older mother, smoking, and poor diet.[12][10] There is no known safe amount or safe time to drink during pregnancy.[1][13] While drinking small amounts of alcohol does not cause abnormalities in the face, it may cause behavioral issues.[11] Alcohol crosses the blood brain barrier and both directly and indirectly affects a developing baby.[14] Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in the person.[1] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are preventable by avoiding alcohol.[4] For this reason, medical authorities recommend no alcohol during pregnancy or while trying to become pregnant.[15][16][17] While the condition is permanent, treatment can improve outcomes.[1][3] Interventions may include parent-child interaction therapy, efforts to modify child behavior, and possibly medications.[5] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe.[6] FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1000 live births in the United States.[6] In South Africa, some populations have rates as high as 9%.[8] The negative effects of alcohol during pregnancy have been described since ancient times.[8] The lifetime cost per child with FAS was $2,000,000 in 2002 in the US.[6] The term fetal alcohol syndrome was first used in 1973.[8] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Types [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FASDs encompass a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure.[1] The most severe condition is called fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS),[1] which refers to individuals who have a specific set of birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders characteristic of the diagnosis.[18] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.[9] Partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS) refers to individuals with a known, or highly suspected, history of prenatal alcohol exposure who have alcohol-related physical and neurodevelopmental deficits that do not meet the full criteria for FAS.[18] The subtypes of pFAS are alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).[18] In addition to FAS, pFAS, ARND, and ARBD, any other conditions believed to be related to prenatal alcohol exposure, such as spontaneous abortion and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), are also considered to be on the spectrum of related disorders.[18] It is unclear as of 2017 if identifying a FASD-related conditions benefits the individual.[9] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Signs and symptoms [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facial characteristics of a child with FAS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The key of FASD can vary between individuals exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. While consensus exists for the definition and diagnosis of FAS, minor variations among the systems lead to differences in definitions and diagnostic cut-off criteria for other diagnoses across the FASD continuum. The central nervous system damage criteria particularly lack clear consensus. A working knowledge of the key features is helpful in understanding FASD diagnoses and conditions, and each is reviewed with attention to similarities and differences across the four diagnostic systems. More than 400 problems, however, can occur with FASD.[19] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Growth [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In terms of FASD, growth deficiency is defined as significantly below average height, weight or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure, and can be assessed at any point in the lifespan. Growth measurements must be adjusted for parental height, gestational age (for a premature infant), and other postnatal insults (e.g., poor nutrition), although birth height and weight are the preferred measurements.[20] Deficiencies are documented when height or weight falls at or below the 10th percentile of standardized growth charts appropriate to the population.[21] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Criteria for FASD are least specific in the IOM diagnostic system (\"low birth weight..., decelerating weight not due to nutrition..., [or] disproportional low weight to height\" p. 4 of executive summary),[16] while the CDC and Canadian guidelines use the 10th percentile as a cut-off to determine growth deficiency.[2][22] The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" allows for mid-range gradations in growth deficiency (between the 3rd and 10th percentiles) and severe growth deficiency at or below the 3rd percentile.[20] Growth deficiency (at severe, moderate, or mild levels) contributes to diagnoses of FAS and pFAS, but not ARND or static encephalopathy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Growth deficiency is ranked as follows by the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\":[20] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Severe: Height and weight at or below the 3rd percentile. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moderate: Either height or weight at or below the 3rd percentile, but not both. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mild: Either height or weight or both between the 3rd and 10th percentiles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR None: Height and weight both above the 10th percentile. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the initial studies that discovered FAS, growth deficiency was a requirement for inclusion in the studies; thus, all the original people with FAS had growth deficiency as an artifact of sampling characteristics used to establish criteria for the syndrome.[citation needed] That is, growth deficiency is a key feature of FASD because growth deficiency was a criterion for inclusion in the study that defined FAS. This suggests growth deficiency may be less critical for understanding the disabilities of FASD than the neurobehavioral sequelae to the brain damage.[16] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facial features [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several characteristic craniofacial abnormalities are often visible in individuals with FAS.[23] The presence of FAS facial features indicates brain damage, although brain damage may also exist in their absence. FAS facial features (and most other visible, but non-diagnostic, deformities) are believed to be caused mainly during the 10th and 20th week of gestation.[24] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Refinements in diagnostic criteria since 1975 have yielded three distinctive and diagnostically significant facial features known to result from prenatal alcohol exposure and distinguishes FAS from other disorders with partially overlapping characteristics.[25][26] The three FAS facial features are: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A smooth philtrum: The divot or groove between the nose and upper lip flattens with increased prenatal alcohol exposure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thin vermilion: The upper lip thins with increased prenatal alcohol exposure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Small palpebral fissures: Eye width decreases with increased prenatal alcohol exposure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Measurement of FAS facial features uses criteria developed by the University of Washington. The lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the Lip-Philtrum Guide,[27] a five-point Likert Scale with representative photographs of lip and philtrum combinations ranging from normal (ranked 1) to severe (ranked 5). Palpebral fissure length (PFL) is measured in millimeters with either calipers or a clear ruler and then compared to a PFL growth chart, also developed by the University of Washington.[28] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ranking FAS facial features is complicated because the three separate facial features can be affected independently by prenatal alcohol. A summary of the criteria follows:[20][29] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Severe: All three facial features ranked independently as severe (lip ranked at 4 or 5, philtrum ranked at 4 or 5, and PFL two or more standard deviations below average). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moderate: Two facial features ranked as severe and one feature ranked as moderate (lip or philtrum ranked at 3, or PFL between one and two standard deviations below average). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR philtrum ranked at 3, PFL between one and two standard deviations below average). Mild: A mild ranking of FAS facial features covers a broad range of facial feature combinations: Two facial features ranked severe and one ranked within normal limits, One facial feature ranked severe and two ranked moderate, or One facial feature ranked severe, one ranked moderate and one ranked within normal limits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR None: All three facial features ranked within normal limits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Central nervous system [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Central nervous system (CNS) damage is the primary key feature of any FASD diagnosis. Prenatal alcohol exposure, which is classified as a teratogen, can damage the brain across a continuum of gross to subtle impairments, depending on the amount, timing, and frequency of the exposure as well as genetic predispositions of the fetus and mother.[16][30] While functional abnormalities are the behavioral and cognitive expressions of the FASD disability, CNS damage can be assessed in three areas: structural, neurological, and functional impairments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All four diagnostic systems allow for assessment of CNS damage in these areas, but criteria vary. The IOM system requires structural or neurological impairment for a diagnosis of FAS, but also allows a \"complex pattern\" of functional anomalies for diagnosing PFAS and ARND.[16] The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" and CDC guidelines allow for a positive CNS finding in any of the three areas for any FASD diagnosis, but functional anomalies must measure at two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains for a diagnosis of FAS, PFAS, and ARND.[20][22] The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" also allows for an FASD diagnosis when only two functional domains are measured at two standard deviations or worse.[20] The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" further elaborates the degree of CNS damage according to four ranks: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Definite: Structural impairments or neurological impairments for FAS or static encephalopathy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Probable: Significant dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Possible: Mild to moderate dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in one or two functional domains or by judgment of the clinical evaluation team that CNS damage cannot be dismissed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR by judgment of the clinical evaluation team that CNS damage cannot be dismissed. Unlikely: No evidence of CNS damage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Structural [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Structural abnormalities of the brain are observable, physical damage to the brain or brain structures caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Structural impairments may include microcephaly (small head size) of two or more standard deviations below the average, or other abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia).[16] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Microcephaly is determined by comparing head circumference (often called occipitofrontal circumference, or OFC) to appropriate OFC growth charts.[21] Other structural impairments must be observed through medical imaging techniques by a trained physician. Because imaging procedures are expensive and relatively inaccessible to most people, diagnosis of FAS is not frequently made via structural impairments, except for microcephaly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Evidence of a CNS structural impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS, and neurological and functional impairments are highly likely.[2][16][20][22] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the first trimester of pregnancy, alcohol interferes with the migration and organization of brain cells, which can create structural deformities or deficits within the brain.[31] During the third trimester, damage can be caused to the hippocampus, which plays a role in memory, learning, emotion, and encoding visual and auditory information, all of which can create neurological and functional CNS impairments as well.[32] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As of 2002, there were 25 reports of autopsies on infants known to have FAS. The first was in 1973, on an infant who died shortly after birth.[33] The examination revealed extensive brain damage, including microcephaly, migration anomalies, callosal dysgenesis, and a massive neuroglial, leptomeningeal heterotopia covering the left hemisphere.[34] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1977, Dr. Clarren described a second infant whose mother was a binge drinker. The infant died ten days after birth. The autopsy showed severe hydrocephalus, abnormal neuronal migration, and a small corpus callosum (which connects the two brain hemispheres) and cerebellum.[34] FAS has also been linked to brainstem and cerebellar changes, agenesis of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, neuronal migration errors, absent olfactory bulbs, meningomyelocele, and porencephaly.[34] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neurological [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When structural impairments are not observable or do not exist, neurological impairments are assessed. In the context of FASD, neurological impairments are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure which causes general neurological damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system, or the autonomic nervous system. A determination of a neurological problem must be made by a trained physician, and must not be due to a postnatal insult, such as a high fever, concussion, traumatic brain injury, etc. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All four diagnostic systems show virtual agreement on their criteria for CNS damage at the neurological level, and evidence of a CNS neurological impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS or pFAS, and functional impairments are highly likely.[2][16][20][22] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neurological problems are expressed as either hard signs, or diagnosable disorders, such as epilepsy or other seizure disorders, or soft signs. Soft signs are broader, nonspecific neurological impairments, or symptoms, such as impaired fine motor skills, neurosensory hearing loss, poor gait, clumsiness, poor eye-hand coordination. Many soft signs have norm-referenced criteria, while others are determined through clinical judgment. \"Clinical judgment\" is only as good as the clinician, and soft signs should be assessed by either a pediatric neurologist, a pediatric neuropsychologist, or both. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Functional [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When structural or neurological impairments are not observed, all four diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure to be assessed in terms of functional impairments.[2][16][20][22] Functional impairments are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, often referred to as developmental disabilities. There is no consensus on a specific pattern of functional impairments due to prenatal alcohol exposure[16] and only CDC guidelines label developmental delays as such,[22] so criteria (and FASD diagnoses) vary somewhat across diagnostic systems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The four diagnostic systems list various CNS domains that can qualify for functional impairment that can determine an FASD diagnosis: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related signs [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other conditions may commonly co-occur with FAS, stemming from prenatal alcohol exposure. However, these conditions are considered alcohol-related birth defects[16] and not diagnostic criteria for FAS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cause [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fetal alcohol syndrome usually occurs when a pregnant woman has more than four standard drinks per day.[36] Milder symptoms have been found with two drinks per day during the early part of pregnancy.[36][37] Among those who are alcoholic about a third of children have FAS.[36] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Evidence of harm from less than two drinks per day or 10 drinks per week is not clear.[36][38] While small amounts of alcohol do not cause an abnormal appearance, it may cause behavioral issues.[11] There is conflicting evidence regarding whether drinking by fathers before conception can cause FAS.[36] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mechanism [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite intense research efforts, the exact mechanism for the development of FAS or FASD is unknown. On the contrary, clinical and animal studies have identified a broad spectrum of pathways through which maternal alcohol can negatively affect the outcome of a pregnancy. Clear conclusions with universal validity are difficult to draw, since different ethnic groups show considerable genetic polymorphism for the hepatic enzymes responsible for ethanol detoxification.[39] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Genetic examinations have revealed a continuum of long-lasting molecular effects that are not only timing specific but are also dosage specific; with even moderate amounts being able to cause alterations.[40] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A human fetus appears to be at triple risk from maternal alcohol consumption:[41][42] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The placenta allows free entry of ethanol and toxic metabolites like acetaldehyde into the fetal compartment. The so-called placental barrier is of almost no barrier with respect to ethanol. The developing fetal nervous system appears particularly sensitive to ethanol toxicity. The latter interferes with proliferation, differentiation, neuronal migration, axonic outgrowth, integration, and fine-tuning of the synaptic network. In short, all major processes in the developing central nervous system appear compromised. Fetal tissues are quite different from adult tissues in function and purpose. For example, the main detoxicating organ in adults is the liver, whereas the fetal liver is incapable of detoxifying ethanol, as the ADH and ALDH enzymes have not yet been brought to expression at this early stage. Up to term, fetal tissues do not have significant capacity for the detoxification of ethanol, and the fetus remains exposed to ethanol in the amniotic fluid for periods far longer than the decay time of ethanol in the maternal circulation. The lack of significant quantities of ADH and ALDH means that fetal tissues have much lower quantities of antioxidant enzymes, like SOD, glutathione transferases, and glutathion peroxidases, resulting in antioxidant protection being much less effective.[ citation needed ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Diagnosis [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because admission of alcohol use during pregnancy can stigmatize birth mothers, many are reluctant to admit drinking or to provide an accurate report of the quantity they drank. This complicates diagnosis and treatment [22] of the syndrome. As a result, diagnosis of the severity of FASD relies on protocols of observation of the child's physiology and behavior rather than maternal self-reporting. Presently, four FASD diagnostic systems that diagnose FAS and other FASD conditions have been developed in North America: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Institute of Medicine's guidelines for FAS, the first system to standardize diagnoses of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure; [16] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The University of Washington's \"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code\", which ranks the four key features of FASD on a Likert scale of one to four and yields 256 descriptive codes that can be categorized into 22 distinct clinical categories, ranging from FAS to no findings; [20] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Centers for Disease Control's \"Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis\", which established consensus on the diagnosis FAS in the U.S. but deferred addressing other FASD conditions; [22] and NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR and Canadian guidelines for FASD diagnoses, which established criteria for diagnosing FASD in Canada and harmonized most differences between the IOM and University of Washington's systems.[2] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each diagnostic system requires that a complete FASD evaluation includes an assessment of the four key features of FASD, described below. A positive finding on all four features is required for a diagnosis of FAS. However, prenatal alcohol exposure and central nervous system damage are the critical elements of the spectrum of FASD, and a positive finding in these two features is sufficient for an FASD diagnosis that is not \"full-blown FAS\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the four diagnostic systems essentially agree on criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), there are still differences when full criteria for FAS are not met. This has resulted in differing and evolving nomenclature for other conditions across the spectrum of FASD, which may account for such a wide variety of terminology. Most individuals with deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure do not express all features of FAS and fall into other FASD conditions.[16] The Canadian guidelines recommend the assessment and descriptive approach of the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" for each key feature of FASD and the terminology of the IOM in diagnostic categories, excepting ARBD.[2] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thus, other FASD conditions are partial expressions of FAS. However, these other FASD conditions may create disabilities similar to FAS if the key area of central nervous system damage shows clinical deficits in two or more of ten domains of brain functioning. Essentially, even though growth deficiency and/or FAS facial features may be mild or nonexistent in other FASD conditions, yet clinically significant brain damage of the central nervous system is present. In these other FASD conditions, an individual may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes because brain damage is present without associated visual cues of poor growth or the \"FAS face\" that might ordinarily trigger an FASD evaluation. Such individuals may be misdiagnosed with primary mental health disorders such as ADHD or oppositional defiance disorder without appreciation that brain damage is the underlying cause of these disorders, which requires a different treatment paradigm than typical mental health disorders. While other FASD conditions may not yet be included as an ICD or DSM-IV-TR diagnosis, they nonetheless pose significant impairment in functional behavior because of underlying brain damage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fetal alcohol syndrome [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The following criteria must be fully met for an FAS diagnosis:[2][16][20][22] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Growth deficiency: Prenatal or postnatal height or weight (or both) at or below the 10th percentile[21] FAS facial features: All three FAS facial features present[28] Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural neurological, or functional impairment Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed or Unknown prenatal alcohol exposure NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the first diagnosable condition of FASD that was discovered. FAS is the only expression of FASD that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis. To make this diagnosis or determine any FASD condition, a multi-disciplinary evaluation is necessary to assess each of the four key features for assessment. Generally, a trained physician will determine growth deficiency and FAS facial features. While a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities and/or neurological problems, usually central nervous system damage is determined through psychological, speech-language, and occupational therapy assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains.[43] Prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician, psychologist, social worker, or chemical health counselor. These professionals work together as a team to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative, multi-disciplinary report to diagnose FAS (or other FASD conditions) in an individual. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Partial FAS [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Partial FAS (pFAS) was previously known as atypical FAS in the 1997 edition of the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\". People with pFAS have a confirmed history of prenatal alcohol exposure, but may lack growth deficiency or the complete facial stigmata. Central nervous system damage is present at the same level as FAS. These individuals have the same functional disabilities but \"look\" less like FAS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of Partial FAS:[2][16][20] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to deficient[21] FAS facial features: Two or three FAS facial features present[28] Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, or functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains[43] Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fetal alcohol effects [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fetal alcohol effects (FAE) is a previous term for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects.[1] It was initially used in research studies to describe humans and animals in whom teratogenic effects were seen after confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (or unknown exposure for humans), but without obvious physical anomalies.[44] Smith (1981) described FAE as an \"extremely important concept\" to highlight the debilitating effects of brain damage, regardless of the growth or facial features.[45] This term has fallen out of favor with clinicians because it was often regarded by the public as a less severe disability than FAS, when in fact its effects can be just as detrimental.[46] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) was initially suggested by the Institute of Medicine to replace the term FAE and focus on central nervous system damage, rather than growth deficiency or FAS facial features. The Canadian guidelines also use this diagnosis and the same criteria. While the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" includes these criteria for three of its diagnostic categories, it refers to this condition as static encephalopathy. The behavioral effects of ARND are not necessarily unique to alcohol however, so use of the term must be within the context of confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure.[47] ARND may be gaining acceptance over the terms FAE and ARBD to describe FASD conditions with central nervous system abnormalities or behavioral or cognitive abnormalities or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure without regard to growth deficiency or FAS facial features.[47][48] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of ARND or static encephalopathy:[2][16][20] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to minimally deficient[21] FAS facial features: Minimal or no FAS facial features present[28] Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, or functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains[43] Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure;0 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alcohol-related birth defects [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), formerly known as possible fetal alcohol effect (PFAE),[44] was a term proposed as an alternative to FAE and PFAE[49] The IOM presents ARBD as a list of congenital anomalies that are linked to maternal alcohol use but have no key features of FASD.[16] PFAE and ARBD have fallen out of favor because these anomalies are not necessarily specific to maternal alcohol consumption and are not criteria for diagnosis of FASD.[47] The Canadian guidelines recommend that ARBD should not be used as an umbrella term or diagnostic category for FASD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Exposure [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prenatal alcohol exposure is determined by interview of the biological mother or other family members knowledgeable of the mother's alcohol use during the pregnancy (if available), prenatal health records (if available), and review of available birth records, court records (if applicable), chemical dependency treatment records (if applicable), or other reliable sources. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Exposure level is assessed as confirmed exposure, unknown exposure, and confirmed absence of exposure by the IOM, CDC and Canadian diagnostic systems. The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" further distinguishes confirmed exposure as High Risk and Some Risk: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR High Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy known to be at high blood alcohol levels (100 mg/dL or greater) delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy with use less than High Risk or unknown usage patterns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unknown Risk: Unknown use of alcohol during pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No Risk: Confirmed absence of prenatal alcohol exposure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Confirmed exposure [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Amount, frequency, and timing of prenatal alcohol use can dramatically impact the other three key features of FASD. While consensus exists that alcohol is a teratogen, there is no clear consensus as to what level of exposure is toxic.[16] The CDC guidelines are silent on these elements diagnostically. The IOM and Canadian guidelines explore this further, acknowledging the importance of significant alcohol exposure from regular or heavy episodic alcohol consumption in determining, but offer no standard for diagnosis. Canadian guidelines discuss this lack of clarity and parenthetically point out that \"heavy alcohol use\" is defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism as five or more drinks per episode on five or more days during a 30-day period.[50] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" ranking system distinguishes between levels of prenatal alcohol exposure as high risk and some risk. It operationalizes high risk exposure as a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) greater than 100 mg/dL delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. This BAC level is typically reached by a 55 kg female drinking six to eight beers in one sitting.[20] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unknown exposure [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For many adopted or adults and children in foster care, records or other reliable sources may not be available for review. Reporting alcohol use during pregnancy can also be stigmatizing to birth mothers, especially if alcohol use is ongoing.[22] In these cases, all diagnostic systems use an unknown prenatal alcohol exposure designation. A diagnosis of FAS is still possible with an unknown exposure level if other key features of FASD are present at clinical levels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Confirmed absence of exposure [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Confirmed absence of exposure would apply to planned pregnancies in which no alcohol was used or pregnancies of women who do not use alcohol or report no use during the pregnancy. This designation is relatively rare, as most people presenting for an FASD evaluation are at least suspected to have had a prenatal alcohol exposure due to presence of other key features of FASD.[20][22] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ten brain domains [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A recent effort to standardize assessment of functional CNS damage has been suggested by an experienced FASD diagnostic team in Minnesota. The proposed framework attempts to harmonize IOM, 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, CDC, and Canadian guidelines for measuring CNS damage vis-à-vis FASD evaluations and diagnosis. The standardized approach is referred to as the Ten Brain Domains and encompasses aspects of all four diagnostic systems' recommendations for assessing CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure. The framework provides clear definitions of brain dysfunction, specifies empirical data needed for accurate diagnosis, and defines intervention considerations that address the complex nature of FASD with the intention to avoid common secondary disabilities.[43] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The proposed Ten Brain Domains include:[43] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program (FADP) uses unpublished Minnesota state criteria of performance at 1.5 or more standard deviations on standardized testing in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains to determine CNS damage. However, the Ten Brain Domains are easily incorporated into any of the four diagnostic systems' CNS damage criteria, as the framework only proposes the domains, rather than the cut-off criteria for FASD.[51] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Differential diagnosis [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CDC reviewed nine syndromes that have overlapping features with FAS; however, none of these syndromes include all three FAS facial features, and none are the result of prenatal alcohol exposure:[22] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prevention [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The only certain way to prevent FAS is to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy.[47][52] In the United States, the Surgeon General recommended in 1981, and again in 2005, that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or while planning a pregnancy, the latter to avoid damage even in the earliest stages (even weeks) of a pregnancy, as the woman may not be aware that she has conceived.[15] In the United States, federal legislation has required that warning labels be placed on all alcoholic beverage containers since 1988 under the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is some controversy surrounding the \"zero-tolerance\" approach taken by many countries when it comes to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The assertion that moderate drinking causes FAS is said to lack strong evidence and, in fact, the practice of equating a responsible level of drinking with potential harm to the fetus may have negative social, legal, and health impacts.[53] In addition, special care should be taken when considering statistics on this disease, as prevalence and causation is often linked with FASD, which is more common and causes less harm, as opposed to FAS.[54] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Treatment [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is no cure for FASD, but treatment is possible. Because CNS damage, symptoms, secondary disabilities, and needs vary widely by individual, there is no one treatment type that works for everyone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medication [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Psychoactive drugs are frequently tried on those with FASD as many FASD symptoms are mistaken for or overlap with other disorders, most notably ADHD.[55] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Behavioral interventions [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Behavioral interventions are based on the learning theory, which is the basis for many parenting and professional strategies and interventions.[48] Along with ordinary parenting styles, such strategies are frequently used by default for treating those with FAS, as the diagnoses oppositional defiance disorder (ODD), conduct disorder, reactive attachment disorder (RAD) often overlap with FAS (along with ADHD), and these are sometimes thought to benefit from behavioral interventions. Frequently, a person's poor academic achievement results in special education services, which also utilizes principles of learning theory, behavior modification, and outcome-based education. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Developmental framework [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many books and handouts on FAS recommend a developmental approach, based on developmental psychology, even though most do not specify it as such and provide little theoretical background. Optimal human development generally occurs in identifiable stages (e.g., Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development, Erik Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, John Bowlby's attachment framework, and other developmental stage theories). FAS interferes with normal development,[56] which may cause stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed. Over time, an unaffected child can negotiate the increasing demands of life by progressing through stages of development normally, but not so for a child with FAS.[56] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By knowing what developmental stages and tasks children follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can be tailored to helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully.[56] If a person is delayed in the adaptive behavior domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying shoelaces), giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using slip-on shoes) to support the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's developmental context into account while developing interventions.[citation needed] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advocacy model [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The advocacy model takes the point of view that someone is needed to actively mediate between the environment and the person with FAS.[47] Advocacy activities are conducted by an advocate (for example, a family member, friend, or case manager) and fall into three basic categories. An advocate for FAS: (1) interprets FAS and the disabilities that arise from it and explains it to the environment in which the person operates, (2) engenders change or accommodation on behalf of the person, and (3) assists the person in developing and reaching attainable goals.[47] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The advocacy model is often recommended, for example, when developing an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for the person's progress at school.[55] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An understanding of the developmental framework would presumably inform and enhance the advocacy model, but advocacy also implies interventions at a systems level as well, such as educating schools, social workers, and so forth on best practices for FAS. However, several organizations devoted to FAS also use the advocacy model at a community practice level as well.[57] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Public health and policy [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Treating FAS at the public health and public policy level promotes FAS prevention and diversion of public resources to assist those with FAS.[47] It is related to the advocacy model but promoted at a systems level (rather than with the individual or family), such as developing community education and supports, state or province level prevention efforts (e.g., screening for maternal alcohol use during OB/GYN or prenatal medical care visits), or national awareness programs. Several organizations and state agencies in the U.S. are dedicated to this type of intervention.[57] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The US Centers for Disease Control estimates 3 million women in the United States are at risk of having a baby with FASD, and recommended that women of child-bearing age should be on birth control or abstain from drinking alcohol as the safest way to avoid this.[58] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prognosis [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Primary disabilities [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The primary disabilities of FAS are the functional difficulties with which the child is born as a result of CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure.[59] Often, primary disabilities are mistaken as behavior problems, but the underlying CNS damage is the originating source of a functional difficulty,[60] rather than a mental health condition, which is considered a secondary disability. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The exact mechanisms for functional problems of primary disabilities are not always fully understood, but animal studies have begun to shed light on some correlates between functional problems and brain structures damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure.[47] Representative examples include: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Functional difficulties may result from CNS damage in more than one domain, but common functional difficulties by domain include:[47][48][56][60] Note that this is not an exhaustive list of difficulties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secondary disabilities [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The secondary disabilities of FAS are those that arise later in life secondary to CNS damage. These disabilities often emerge over time due to a mismatch between the primary disabilities and environmental expectations; secondary disabilities can be ameliorated with early interventions and appropriate supportive services.[59] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Six main secondary disabilities were identified in a University of Washington research study of 473 subjects diagnosed with FAS, PFAS (partial fetal alcohol syndrome), and ARND (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder):[47][59] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mental health problems: Diagnosed with ADHD, Clinical Depression, or other mental illness, experienced by over 90% of the subjects NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Disrupted school experience: Suspended or expelled from school or dropped out of school, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trouble with the law: Charged or convicted with a crime, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Confinement: For inpatient psychiatric care, inpatient chemical dependency care, or incarcerated for a crime, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Inappropriate sexual behavior: Sexual advances, sexual touching, or promiscuity, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alcohol and drug problems: Abuse or dependency, experienced by 35% of the subjects (age 12 and older) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two additional secondary disabilities exist for adults:[47][59] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dependent living: Group home, living with family or friends, or some sort of assisted living, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Problems with employment: Required ongoing job training or coaching, could not keep a job, unemployed, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Protective factors and strengths [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eight factors were identified in the same study as universal protective factors that reduced the incidence rate of the secondary disabilities:[47][59] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Living in a stable and nurturing home for over 73% of life NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Being diagnosed with FAS before age six NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Never having experienced violence NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Remaining in each living situation for at least 2.8 years NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Experiencing a \"good quality home\" (meeting 10 or more defined qualities) from age 8 to 12 years old NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Having been found eligible for developmental disability (DD) services NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Having basic needs met for at least 13% of life NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Having a diagnosis of FAS (rather than another FASD condition) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Malbin (2002) has identified the following areas of interests and talents as strengths that often stand out for those with FASD and should be utilized, like any strength, in treatment planning:[48] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Music, playing instruments, composing, singing, art, spelling, reading, computers, mechanics, woodworking, skilled vocations (welding, electrician, etc.), writing, poetry NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Participation in non-impact sport or physical fitness activities NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Epidemiology [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe.[6] FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1000 live births in the United States.[6] The lifetime cost of an individual with FAS were estimated to be two million USD in 2002.[6] Drinking any quantity during pregnancy, the risk to give birth to a FAS is about 1,5%, and to a FASD about 15%. Drinking large quantities, defined as 2 standard drinks a day, or 6 standard drinks in a short time, give a 50% risk to a FAS birth.[64] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Australia [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FASD among Australian youth is more common in indigenous Australians.[65] The only states that have registered birth defects in Australian youth are Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.[66] In Australia only 12% of Australian health professionals are aware of the diagnostics and symptoms of FASD.[65] In Western Australia, the rate of births resulting in FASD is 0.02 per 1000 births for non-Indigenous Australians, however among indigenous births the rate is 2.76 per 1000 births.[66] In Victoria, there have been no registered FASD related births for indigenous Australians, but the rate for the general population in Victoria is 0.01-0.03 per 1000 births.[66] There have been no dedicated FASD clinics within Western Australia, but there are also no nationally supported diagnostic criteria anywhere in Australia.[67] Passive surveillance is a prevention technique used within Australia to assist in monitoring and establishing detectable defects during pregnancy and childhood.[66] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR History [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From the 1960s to the 1980s, alcohol was commonly used as a tocolytic, a method to stop preterm labor. The method originated with Dr. Fritz Fuchs, the chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Cornell University Medical College.[68][69] Doctors recommended a small amount of alcohol to calm the uterus during contractions in early pregnancy or Braxton Hicks contractions. In later stages of pregnancy, the alcohol was administered intravenously and often in large amounts. \"Women experienced similar effects as occur with oral ingestion, including intoxication, nausea and vomiting, and potential alcohol poisoning, followed by hangovers when the alcohol was discontinued.\"[70] Vomiting put the mother at a high risk for aspiration and was \"a brutal procedure for all involved.\" [68] Because the alcohol was being given intravenously, the doctor could continue giving the treatment to the mother long after she had passed out, resulting in her being more intoxicated than would otherwise be possible. Such heavy intoxication is highly likely to contribute to FASD.[68] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Historical references [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anecdotal accounts of prohibitions against maternal alcohol use from Biblical, ancient Greek, and ancient Roman sources[71] imply a historical awareness of links between maternal alcohol use and negative child outcomes.[33] For example, in the Bible, Judges 13:4 (addressed to a woman who was going to have a baby) reads: \"Therefore be careful and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean\" (ESV). In 1725 British physicians petitioned the House of Commons on the effects of strong drink when consumed by pregnant women saying that such drinking is “…too often the cause of weak, feeble, and distempered children, who must be, instead of an advantage and strength, a charge to their country.”[72] There are many other such historical references. In Gaelic Scotland, the mother and nurse were not allowed to consume ale during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Martin Martin). Claims that alcohol consumption caused idiocy were part of the Teetotalism's message in the 19th century,[73] but such claims, despite some attempts to offer evidence, were ignored because no mechanism could be advanced.[74] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The earliest recorded observation of possible links between maternal alcohol use and fetal damage was made in 1899 by Dr. William Sullivan, a Liverpool prison physician who noted higher rates of stillbirth for 120 alcoholic female prisoners than their sober female relatives; he suggested the causal agent to be alcohol use.[75] This contradicted the predominating belief at the time that heredity caused intellectual disability, poverty, and criminal behavior, which contemporary studies on the subjects usually concluded.[47] A case study by Henry H. Goddard of the Kallikak family—popular in the early 1900s—represents this earlier perspective,[76] though later researchers have suggested that the Kallikaks almost certainly had FAS.[77] General studies and discussions on alcoholism throughout the mid-1900s were typically based on a heredity argument.[78] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prior to fetal alcohol syndrome being specifically identified and named in 1973, only a few studies had noted differences between the children of mothers who used alcohol during pregnancy or breast-feeding and those who did not, and identified alcohol use as a possible contributing factor rather than heredity.[47] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recognition as a syndrome [ edit ] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fetal Alcohol Syndrome was named in 1973 by two dysmorphologists, Drs. Kenneth Lyons Jones and David Weyhe Smith of the University of Washington Medical School in Seattle, United States. They identified a pattern of \"craniofacial, limb, and cardiovascular defects associated with prenatal onset growth deficiency and developmental delay\" in eight unrelated children of three ethnic groups, all born to mothers who were alcoholics.[79] The pattern of malformations indicated that the damage was prenatal. News of the discovery shocked some, while others were skeptical of the findings.[80] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Paul Lemoine of Nantes, France had already published a study in a French medical journal in 1968 about children with distinctive features whose mothers were alcoholics,[81] and in the U.S., Christy Ulleland and colleagues at the University of Washington Medical School had conducted an 18-month study in 1968–1969 documenting the risk of maternal alcohol consumption among the offspring of 11 alcoholic mothers.[82] The Washington and Nantes findings were confirmed by a research group in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1979.[83] Researchers in France, Sweden, and the United States were struck by how similar these children looked, though they were not related, and how they behaved in the same unfocused and hyperactive manner.[83] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within nine years of the Washington discovery, animal studies, including non-human monkey studies carried out at the University of Washington Primate Center by Dr. Sterling Clarren, had confirmed that alcohol was a teratogen. By 1978, 245 cases of FAS had been reported by medical researchers, and the syndrome began to be described as the most frequent known cause of intellectual disability. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While many syndromes are eponymous, i.e. named after the physician first reporting the association of symptoms, Dr. Smith named FAS after the causal agent of the symptoms.[84] He reasoned that doing so would encourage prevention, believing that if people knew maternal alcohol consumption caused the syndrome, then abstinence during pregnancy would follow from patient education and public awareness.[84] At the time, nobody was aware of the full range of possible birth defects from FAS or its rate of prevalence.[84] Over time, as subsequent research and clinical experience suggested that a range of effects (including physical, behavioral, and cognitive) could arise from prenatal alcohol exposure, the term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) was developed to include FAS as well as other conditions resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure.[84] Currently, FAS[16][44][79] is the only expression of prenatal alcohol exposure defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and assigned ICD-9 and diagnoses.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plaintiff Myrna Arias, a former Bakersfield sales executive for money transfer service Intermex, claims in a state court lawsuit that her boss, John Stubits, fired her shortly after she uninstalled the job-management Xora app that she and her colleagues were required to use.

Plaintiff expressed that she had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but she objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours and complained to Stubits that this was an invasion of her privacy.

(CN) - A money-transfer company fired an employee for refusing to install an app that would track her location even when she was off the clock, the woman claims in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Myrna Arias sued Intermex Wire Transfer LLC in Kern County Superior Court on May 5. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Headquartered in Miami, Florida, Intermex describes itself on its website as \" a leading processor of money-transfer services in the U.S. to Latin America corridor.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It has 30,000 locations worldwide and offers services in 45 states and 16 Latin American countries, the website adds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias says she worked for Intermex as a sales executive and account manager from February 2014 to May 2014. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She was still working for rival NetSpend Corporation when she was hired. Her boss, Intermex's regional vice president of sales John Stubits, agreed to let her work for both NetSpend and Intermex for three months until she qualified for Intermex's medical insurance because she was suffering from a severe vitamin B-12 deficiency and did not want to lose her treatment, according to the complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias says she did well at her job, meeting all her quotas and earning around $7,250 a month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But everything changed in April 2014, when she claims Stubits told her and several other employees to download an app from Xora onto their smartphones that \"contained a global positioning system function which tracked the exact location of the person possessing the smartphones on which it was installed.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Xora Inc., now ClickSoftware Solution, is not a party to the complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a September 2011 press release, the app enables employees to create electronic timecards on their phones to track when their shifts start, when they take breaks, and when a shift ends. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Plaintiff attorney Gail Glick told Courthouse News that Arias was one of the first employees asked to put the app on her phone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They were guinea pigs,\" Glick said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias says in her complaint that she researched the app and asked Stubits if Intermex would be tracking her whereabouts when she was off the clock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Stubits admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments ever since she had installed the app on her phone,\" Arias says in her complaint. \"Plaintiff expressed that she had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but she objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours and complained to Stubits that this was an invasion of her privacy. She likened the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet and informed Stubits that his actions were illegal. Stubits replied that she should tolerate the illegal intrusion because Intermex was paying plaintiff more than NetSpend.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stubits also told Arias she had to keep her phone on \"24/7\" to assist clients, and \"scolded\" her when she uninstalled the app to protect her privacy, the complaint adds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias says Intermex fired her a few weeks later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Glick said that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a \"legitimate business interest\" to do so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"But if an employee can't stop it, then that is a complete violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias objected to the app because there was no way to turn it off when she was at home. Even if she shut down the app on her phone, it would still be running in the background, Glick said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" she added. \"She was not underperforming, so there was no reason to monitor her.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To make matters worse, Glick said, Intermex was so angry at her objection to the app that it went \"above and beyond a normal wrongful termination and interfered with her ability to earn a livelihood.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias says in her complaint that Robert Lisy, Intermex's president and CEO, \"telephoned John Nelson, vice president of NetSpend, and informed Nelson that plaintiff had been disloyal to NetSpend and was employed by Intermex. As a result of Lisy's intentional and malicious interference with plaintiff's contract with NetSpend, NetSpend fired plaintiff promptly. NetSpend specifically cited Lisy's phone call as the reason for the decision to terminate plaintiff,\" the complaint states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lisy, Nelson and NetSpend are not parties to the complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With two black marks against her and a gap in her employment record, Arias has had a hard time finding a new job, Glick said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives for Intermex did not respond to comment requests by press time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arias seeks an injunction and general, special and punitive damages for invasion of privacy, retaliation, labor code violations, intentional interference with contract, wrongful termination and unfair business practices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her attorney Gail A. Glick is with Alexander, Krakow & Glick of Santa Monica. \"We intend to pursue this aggressively and get her the justice she deserves,\" Glick said. \"What we have here is a really egregious situation, and we are hoping to right that wrong.\"\n", "answers": ["Myrna Arias didn't like the GPS app on her phone that constantly tracked her, so she uninstalled it.

Arias started researching the app, then called Xora—its website touts the app's ability to let employers \"instantly see where their employees are and where they have been\"—and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe “safest” drug for relieving aches and pains, lowering fever and treating headaches in pregnancy may not be so safe after all, according to a new report — it may raise the risk of ADHD and similar disorders in their children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen, sold under the brand name Tylenol, were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They say it doesn’t mean that pregnant women must never, ever take the drug, but they said women may want to avoid using it frequently until more studies have been done. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We aren’t saying if you take one Tylenol once it will give your child hyperactivity,” said Dr. Beate Ritz, an epidemiologist at the University of California Los Angeles who worked on the study. \"You should just avoid chronic or long-term use.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Infections such as influenza in pregnancy are known to affect the brain development of babies — they’re linked to autism, for instance. It’s one of the many reasons pregnant women are urged to get flu shots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So the researchers in this study were careful to ask women if they were taking the acetaminophen pills to reduce a fever to treat flu symptoms. Even when taking this into account, women who took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with ADHD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team used an ongoing Danish study of 64,000 children and their mothers, who were called up regularly during pregnancy and asked whether they had taken any painkillers at all. “All these women were asked had they taken any pain medications and fever medications, any medications,” Ritz said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We aren’t saying if you take one Tylenol once it will give your child hyperactivity. … You should just avoid chronic or long-term use.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About half had taken acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, Ritz’s team reports Monday in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They also reported what kind of disorders they had. But there are viral infections that the woman doesn’t even recognize. She just feels a little malaise.” That is why it is possible that it may not be the drug itself to blame, but some infection the women had, Ritz and other experts point out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s also possible that women who feel pain more acutely, and take painkillers more often, may also have some sort of genetic predisposition that raises the risk of ADHD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers were not able to make a clear estimate of risk based on dose. But women who reported ever taking the drug had a 29 percent higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD, and a 37 percent higher risk of a rarer diagnosis called hyperkinetic syndrome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the findings don't show a clear cause-and-effect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t think one study alone is enough to say nobody should use acetaminophen in pregnancy,” said Dr. Jeff Chapa of Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital, who was not involved in the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, there are suspicions about acetaminophen. UCLA’s Dr. Jorn Olsen, who designed and led the study, had set it up because of lab studies suggesting that acetaminophen might have a hormone-like effect on the developing fetus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And it’s not the first study to show something may happen in people, too. A study late last year showed that women who took acetaminophen frequently during pregnancy raised the risk of behavior problems in their children by 70 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Pregnancy is just a very sensitive period of time where the hormones are very important to development,” Ritz said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And although acetaminophen is considered a very gentle drug, it is not harmless. Large doses can damage the liver and even kill. The Food and Drug Administration has asked drug companies to limit how much they put into products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn’t possible to compare acetaminophen to other painkillers and fever reducers, such as ibuprofen, because pregnant women so rarely took them, Ritz said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chapa raises another possibility. Maybe moms who favor acetaminophen for themselves also gave it to their children when they were very young and their brains were still developing. “Are those moms also more likely to give acetaminophen to their children after birth?” he asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The immediate take-home message is that if you are taking a lot, maybe you shouldn’t.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kate Langley, a neuroscientist at Britain’s Cardiff University, notes that it’s likely that more than one thing is going on with kids who develop ADHD. “ADHD is a complex disorder so it means that there are lots of different risk factors and we know a bit about some of them but we don’t know a great deal,” said Langley, who helped write a commentary on the findings. “We know that there are genetic and environmental and possibly prenatal (factors) but we know that none of them on their own cause ADHD.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ADHD diagnoses are on the rise. More than 1 in 10 children has been diagnosed with ADHD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although much of this is due to awareness and not a real increase in incidence, experts say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nonetheless, pregnant women need to weigh the risks, Ritz says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We make these tradeoffs all the time. We would not take a woman off antibiotics when she has a severe infection during pregnancy,” Ritz said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s the risk-benefit ratio. As much as we want to avoid every type of risk, it is not possible.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this case, she advised, it might be worth toughing out a headache. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The immediate take-home message is that if you are taking a lot, maybe you shouldn’t, and really question whether you need to take it,” Chapa added. “And if you do that’s fine, but take a small quantity for a small duration. If you have chronic pain, maybe don’t take acetaminophen for it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McNeil Consumer Healthcare, which makes Tylenol, said pregnant and breastfeeding women whould consult their doctors before taking any medication. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are aware of the recent JAMA Pediatrics study; however, there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development,\" the company said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NBC News intern Nikita Japra and Medical Fellow Hayley Goldbach contributed to this story.\nPassage 2:\nDoctors frequently recommend acetaminophen, commonly found in over-the-counter pain relievers including Tylenol, to pregnant women for treating mild pain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a new study out of Denmark suggests the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy could be associated with ADHD-like behavioral problems in children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “(Pregnant women) shouldn’t worry at this point,” says study author Dr. Beate Ritz, professor and chair of the epidemiology department at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health. “But if I were a woman who was pregnant ... I would try to avoid taking painkillers as much as I can until we know more about this.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study, published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data from more than 64,000 children enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort study between 1996 and 2002. Mothers in the cohort study reported on their children’s behavior, and the researchers looked at databases to determine how many prescriptions for ADHD drugs were written and how many children received a diagnosis of a severe form of ADHD called hyperkinetic disorder, or HKD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study authors concluded that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with HKD or being prescribed ADHD medications and “exhibiting ADHD-like behaviors.\" It's important to note that ADHD-like behaviors are not the same as having ADHD. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An accompanying editorial published in JAMA Pediatrics emphasizes that the study has found “an interesting observed association,” but that the researchers did not find that acetaminophen causes ADHD. The study authors agree that their results do not show a cause-and-effect relationship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The data suggests that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy is associated with higher risks, Ritz says. When women reported use for 20 weeks or more, their children had a 50% increased risk for receiving ADHD medication, according to the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ritz says more than half of all mothers in the study reported some acetaminophen use while pregnant. The study measured how many weeks the mother reported taking any amount of acetaminophen but did not take the dosage into account. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When used as directed, Tylenol has one of the most favorable safety profiles among over-the-counter pain relievers,” said McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Tylenol. “We are aware of the recent JAMA Pediatrics study; however, there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study’s authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development, citing a previous study done using acetaminophen in rats and a study of acetaminophen and autism done with humans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The cited literature is not relevant to the human condition,” says Dr. Max Wiznitzer, pediatric neurologist and associate professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. “I’m afraid that (women) will think, somehow, that they caused their child’s problem when the study does not tell us that. It tells us that they are linked but does not tell us how.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There are a lot of variables that still need to be considered, such as the fact that ADHD runs in families,” Wiznitzer says. Seventy to 80% of ADHD cases are hereditary, he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study highlights the importance of not taking a drug’s safety during pregnancy for granted, the accompanying editorial points out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There are nonpharmacological ways to deal with pain,” says Dr. Jeffrey Chapa, head of maternal-fetal medicine at Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital. Massages, baths and acupuncture are some alternatives he suggests to help relieve pain. “I think we have to focus a little bit more on that as opposed to just medications.”\n", "answers": ["The bad news about acetaminophen just keeps on coming: A new study finds that use of the drug during pregnancy is linked to \"ADHD-like behavioral problems\" in children, CNN reports.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In interviews in New Zealand, the failed 2008 presidential candidate made clear she had no plans to run again despite talk -- fueled partly by her fellow Democrats' losses in Tuesday's U.S. mid-term elections -- she might embark on a new race.

(Photo: APRIL L BROWN, AP) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the face of new allegations of ghastly animal abuse by its employees, Tyson Foods says it's retraining all of its live poultry workers on the company's animal welfare policies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move by one of the world's largest meat producers came as the animal rights group Compassion Over Killing released secretly-recorded footage on Thursday that shows Tyson workers stomping, kicking and suffocating breeder chickens at facilities in three Virginia counties. Tyson says it has fired ten workers who can be seen in the video, and a senior company executive, Christine Daugherty, described the employees' actions as \"disgusting.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The people shown in the video by Compassion Over Killing were all trained in proper animal handling, yet chose to ignore it and failed to alert management about the despicable treatment on these farms,” said Daugherty, vice president of sustainable food production for Tyson Foods. “Animals in our care deserve to be treated humanely. It’s our responsibility to ensure that everyone who works for our company behaves properly. Our management team is dedicated to continue fostering a culture of proper animal handling.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest video marks at least the fifth time in roughly 13 months that advocates for various animal rights groups have been able to infiltrate Tyson-connected facilities and secretly record footage of workers abusing chickens and cramped living conditions for chickens before they are slaughtered. The activists typically apply for work at the facilities and are able to surreptitiously record the footage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the video released Thursday, a Tyson worker is caught on tape warning the undercover investigator that \"you can't let nobody see you do that\" as he stepped on a chicken's head, suffocating it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You don't know if he's working for the animal rights,\" the worker says. \"It is inhumane standing on his head and let them suffocate. They'll take you to court for that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The footage also shows workers punching, kicking and roughly tossing birds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past, the company has responded to the abuse seen in such videos as inexcusable, while stressing that the abusers were not reflective of Tyson’s institutional commitment to animal welfare. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But with the latest video, Tyson said in a statement, “we believe we haven’t gone far enough and must do more to stop this inexcusable behavior.” The company, which made more than $10 billion in poultry sales last year, says it is now evaluating further steps it can take to ensure animal well-being procedures are being followed throughout its operations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new video has also spurred Tyson to discontinue the practice of inserting plastic tubes in rooster's beaks, something known as beak modification, that helps chicken growers prevent males from eating females' feed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Compassion Over Killing, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C., said it recently made formal complaints about the abuse to prosecutors and animal control officers in Mecklenburg, Lunenburg and Buckingham counties. No charges had been filed as of Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We believe that Tyson as a company needs to be held accountable,\" Erica Meier, the group’s executive director, told USA TODAY. “This is too common of a problem being documented for Tyson's to be pushing this aside as a few rogue workers or bad apples. This is a systemic problem.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Worth Sparkman, a Tyson spokesman, said the company has also been in touch with local authorities about the video, but declined to say whether the company wants to see the employees charged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said that the retraining will impact hundreds of Tyson’s employees working in live chicken production. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tyson said in a statement that it has begun meeting with every employee in its chicken operations that handles live birds “to aggressively re-emphasize the importance of proper animal handling and the consequences of not complying with the company’s animal welfare policies.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company also said it conducted a video conference on Thursday in which Tyson's senior management will discuss handling of live birds with managers at the company’s facilities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We take animal well-being very seriously, and we are going to get to the bottom of this,\" Daugherty said.

In typical lawyer fashion, Cohen had an issue with semantics. He was upset with how the media was characterizing the shake up which resulted in Trump appointing new campaign leaders. Cohen insisted that the “change up” was not, in fact, “a shake up.” Earlier today, Trump’s campaign announced Stephen Bannon, the head of Breitbart News, would become Trump’s campaign chief executive, and Kellyanne Conway would take over as the campaign manager. During the segment, Keilar pushed back saying the campaign was “down.” Cohen pushed back: “says who?” Keilar replied “polls.” And things, well, got pretty awkward.

REUTERS/Richland County NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Critics have accused Fields, who is white, of racial bias, something local officials have so far denied, and they say school teachers and administrators and even at least one fellow student have publicly said they support Fields' actions. He had been a school resource officer at Spring Valley High School for seven years, and many there have voiced support for him, Lott said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lott has already asked the FBI to assist in the investigation into the incident, and the Department of Justice has opened a civil rights probe into it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Lott said, \"the student was being disruptive,\" his department's review of the incident led to the conclusion that Field's \"use of force was unacceptable\" and he \"did not follow proper training, proper procedure\" when he \"threw her across the classroom.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because he did not follow proper procedure, Lott said Field's employment was terminated Wednesday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Deputy Ben fields did wrong,\" Lott said. \"We're taking responsibility for that. Police officers make mistakes too. They're human.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The attorney for the teen says his client did suffer several injuries during her arrest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Columbia attorney Todd Rutherford said Wednesday that Fields should have been fired as soon as Lott saw the video recorded by several students at Spring Valley High School in Columbia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She now has a cast on her arm, she has neck and back injuries. She has a Band-Aid on her forehead where she suffered rug burn on her forehead,\" Rutherford said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One student -- who asked that his identity be concealed -- says other kids in the class tried to defuse the situation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She was even told by the students to just get up and leave when the administrator came in,\" the student said.

Doris Kenny said she's proud her daughter was \"brave enough to speak out against what was going on.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lott said the charges against the two students would not be dropped and would be dealt with at a later date. However, he commended the students who recorded the incident, saying he encouraged citizens to record authorities and bring it to his attention if they think something is wrong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fields, who also helped coach the Spring Valley football team, has prevailed against accusations of excessive force and racial bias before.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gloria was 5,000 miles away at home in Kailua, Hawaii, when the devastating news came in that the 40-year-old was dead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said: “I knew it was Mark. How did I know? Two months earlier, Mark had travelled to New York.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I had come home from work, fixed dinner, and was watching Little House on the Prairie.

The killer himself even told her to leave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, by now deeply religious, she refused, citing the vows they exchanged when married on June 2, 1979. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking through her church, former travel agent Gloria said: “I admit when I got lonely and depressed in that first year of being apart from him, I thought maybe divorce was the right thing to do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Ultimately, I prayed and searched the Bible to read what God says about divorce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Finally, in the book of Malachi, I read, ‘I hate divorce,’ says the Lord God of Israel.’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That settled it, and I closed my Bible. From that point on, I decided I would wait for Mark.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: Andy Johnstone for The Daily Mirror) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gloria’s devotion to killer Chapman comes despite admitting she was violently abused during their one year of marriage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And he cut her off entirely for a year, while not allowing her to see him in jail for almost four. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The couple met in early 1978 in Hawaii. She was 26 and, like Chapman, dedicated her life to the church and hospitals. He was 22 and a ­maintenance worker at Castle Medical Center in Kailua. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A year earlier he had travelled to Hawaii on a one-way ticket before trying to gas himself inside his car. But the vacuum cleaner hose he had used melted in the exhaust and the attempt failed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chapman was admitted to the hospital where he worked, but made what his psychiatrist and the unit’s staff perceived as a rapid recovery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gloria told how their love grew after that first meeting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: New York Daily News) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said: “As I was a travel agent, he wanted my help to plan a vacation around the world. My love for Mark began and grew with each postcard I received. When Mark returned to Hawaii I met him at the airport. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We started dating the following night. By the end of that year, Mark and I felt as though we had known each other for ever. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We talked about everything, including his mental illness and how he had come to Hawaii to kill himself and ended up at a local hospital’s psychiatric ward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He explained that he had gotten well enough to get a job at the hospital as a housekeeper. It seemed to me his mental illness was behind him.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: Splash News) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Gloria said her husband soon started to change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking to The Alliance, a ­“Christian-centred global movement”, she added: “First, Mark lost his new job at the hospital after a run-in with a nursing supervisor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He got angry with me more easily, and on a couple of occasions he hurt me physically. He started drinking and came home drunk. But I took our vows seriously. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I said I will love Mark ‘for richer, for poorer, for better, for worse, in ­sickness, and in health, so long as we both shall live.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the past 25 years, Gloria and Chapman have only been allowed to spend 44 hours each year together during conjugal visits, holed up in the caravan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said they spend their time making pizzas, watching Wheel of Fortune on TV and making love. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chapman’s parole hearing is due to be held the week starting August 20. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Image: Daily Mirror) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Gloria hopes, despite ­objections from Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono, her wait to have him home is a few weeks from ending. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recently, the New York State parole board has been more willing to place heavier emphasis on an inmate’s ­behaviour behind bars than focus on the severity of the crime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a result, several police killers and other ­notorious murderers who had been long denied parole have been set free. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gloria has been praying for Chapman’s release. He was denied freedom at the last hearing in 2016 after officials said he would reoffend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But they commended his ­“acceptance” that his crime was “premeditated and evil”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Chapman has told his wife to have faith in his freedom.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nBy turns warmly sentimental, serial-killer sinister and science-fiction fantastical, \"The Lovely Bones\" was an unlikely book to achieve worldwide success. In the film version, those mismatched elements come back to haunt the story, so to speak, making the final product more hit-and-miss than unblemished triumph.It wasn't only the bestselling nature of Alice Sebold's novel that made \"Bones\" one of the most anticipated films of the year. It was the participation of director Peter Jackson and his regular screenwriting collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, the team that had a considerable triumph with the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.And Jackson is successful re-creating parts of this story told by a 14-year-old girl who is savagely murdered in 1973 and then watches for years from a kind of in-between state that she calls \"the blue horizon between heaven and earth\" as her friends, her family and her killer go on about their lives.His best move by far was casting young Irish actress Saoirse Ronan , Oscar-nominated for her compelling role in \" Atonement,\" as the murdered Susie Salmon. An enormously gifted performer, Ronan is the only element of the film that is exactly as it should be, bringing naturalness, honesty and radiance to the part of a young woman just on the cusp of life.Other elements, including \"The Lovely Bones' \" imaginative notion of what Susie's afterlife looks like, are strong, but everything that's good is undermined by an overemphasis on one part of the story that is essential but has been allowed to overflow its boundaries.That would be the film's decision to foreground its weirdest, creepiest, most shocking elements, starting with the decision to give a much more prominent role to murderer George Harvey. Expertly played by Stanley Tucci, so transformed by makeup as to be almost unrecognizable, Harvey is such an unsettling, toxic individual that the actor says he came close to turning down the role.It's not only Harvey that we see in sometimes grotesque detail, it's the bizarre decorations of the underground murder site that we watch him ever so carefully plan and build, as well as the realistic bodies of his previous victims. And there is of course the chilling time the family spends trying to solve Susie's murder.Though it's unfortunate, this focus will not be a shock to those who know Jackson's films. The director (visible in an amusing cameo examining a movie camera in a shopping mall) began his career with a fondness for splatter-type material with titles like \"Bad Taste\" and \"Braindead.\" It may even be that the chance to fool around with this kind of stuff on a more high-tone level was one thing that drew the filmmaker to the novel in the first place.But though it can be argued that these things, or versions of them, are key points in the novel, seeing them on the screen plays differently, disturbing the story's balance. If Sebold's ultimately soothing novel had focused this much on its off-putting aspects, it never would have found the huge audience it did.Because the book was such a major success, \"The Lovely Bones\" pretty much had its choice of actors for key roles, and in selecting two strong performers, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz, as Susie's father, Jack, and mother, Abigail, both devastated in their own ways by their daughter's death, the film undeniably chose well.But though both actors have their moments, the film's erratic mixture of emotional tones, its decision to go back and forth from missing-Susie sadness to serial-killer sadism, undercuts their ability to give resonant performances.Also hamstrung, but for a different reason, is Susan Sarandon as Grandma Lynn, who's been encouraged to be too over the top for anyone's good.One element of the film that is consistently involving is the dreamscape look of the in-between world where Susie spends her time watching her murderer scheme, her sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) grow up and her parents fall apart. A field of barley that changes into a rolling ocean, huge versions of the ships-in-a-bottle that were her father's hobby, roses blooming under frozen lakes, they all speak to a world, created by New Zealand's Weta Digital and beautifully shot by cinematographer Andrew Lesnie, that is particular to Susie but special to us all.Though \"The Lovely Bones\" never overcomes its tendency to push things too hard, there are moments, almost invariably involving star Ronan, that resonate with the book's comforting notion of a sentient afterlife. To hear Susie speak the novel's signature lines about \"the lovely bones that had grown around my absence\" as she comes to terms with \"the world without me in it\" is to feel what we've been wanting to feel for a long time. It's also to wish that the entire film were as effective as these best moments, but that was not to be.\nPassage 2:\nMatt Mueller NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Directed by Peter Jackson NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Saoirse Ronan, Stanley Tucci, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opens Dec. 11 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jack Salmon (Mark Wahlberg) is a family man and a hobbyist; he adores his wife and kids, especially Susie (Saoirse Ronan), his eldest; he also loves to build miniature ships and deftly slip them into bottles. \"If you start something,\" he tells Susie as he's completing one model, \"you don't give up till you've finished it.\" He glances up, seemingly referring to the ship but staring right at Susie, and adds, \"That is a thing of beauty.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At that sweet moment, Jack doesn't realize he won't have much longer to stare proudly at her. Across the pleasant suburban street in Norristown, Pa., another man, George Harvey (Stanley Tucci), is busy with his own hobbies. He has constructed a dollhouse, pristine and perfectly appointed but untenanted. And in a nearby cornfield, he's created an underground rec room, filled with comic books and figurines and Cokes  a kind of clubhouse where he'd like to bring the local kids. One kid. Susie. (See the top 10 fiction books of 2009.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was 14 years old when I was murdered, on Dec. 6, 1973,\" Susie narrates in this creepy, dreamy film of Alice Sebold's best seller, directed and co-written by The Lord of the Rings' Peter Jackson. The girl, who vanished late one afternoon and is presumed to have been kidnapped or killed, speaks to us from the in-between  a mostly Edenic halfway house for the recently deceased, a bridge between life and a hoped-for heaven. It's a fantasyland of penguin topiary and gigantic ice-sculpture ships, where fields turn into soggy marshes and autumn becomes winter in a flash of fallen leaves. This engrossing, nearly enthralling movie straddles multiple worlds as well: Susie's bright innocence, Mr. Harvey's meticulous depravity and Jack's ferocious determination to sleuth his daughter's fate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like Susie's father and her murderer, Jackson builds models  the foam-rubber puppets of his early Meet the Feebles, the exponentially more complicated imaginary realms of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong  and invites children of all ages to share his obsessions. A director wants to trap life on film, and the prime visual motif of The Lovely Bones is things in artificial enclosures: a penguin in a snow globe, a ship in a bottle, the furniture in a dollhouse, a girl underground, a dead girl in between, some lovely bones in a heavy safe. (See the top 10 movies of 2009.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a director's true gift is to animate these figures, bring them to life. Jackson goes further: he keeps Susie alive after she's died. He's not going for gross-out effects here. He shows Susie's attempt to escape from Mr. Harvey's bunker but not her death. And though the film follows Mr. Harvey as he disposes of Susie's remains, it concentrates on the victim and her loved ones: Jack, his wife Abigail (Rachel Weisz) and their surviving daughter Lindsey (the appealing Rose McIver, who plays Summer Landsdown on the ABC kids' series Power Rangers RPM). She could be Mr. Harvey's unmasker  or his next victim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New Zealand director began his career with horror movies. His well-named debut feature Bad Taste had aliens seeking human flesh for their outer-space fast-food chain, and Braindead (a.k.a. Dead Alive) was a Sumatran-rat-plague movie about mother love gone spectacularly wrong. The Lovely Bones has elements of some of those mulchy horror films, and another, classic one  this could be Psycho as told by the murdered Janet Leigh character. (Norman Bates had a hobby too: taxidermy.) Jackson also allows a strong echo of his 1994 Heavenly Creatures, a terrific, fact-based study of a girlhood crush that blossoms into murder, which pulled precocious performances from two teen beguilers, Melanie Lynskey and the pre-Titanic Kate Winslet. But essentially, the new film is a story of loving and mourning and loving some more. As Susie says of Mr. Harvey, \"He didn't understand how much a father could love his child.\" (See the top 10 movie performances of 2009.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plot has a few pitfalls. Jack, who fingers dozens of Norristown men as Susie's potential abductor, takes ages to notice the strange guy across the street. Abigail, who departs and reappears with little organic reason, is irrelevant to the central daddy-daughter bond. Abigail's mother Lynn (Susan Sarandon) is around only as blowsy comic relief. But she does have one great line: to Abigail, who refuses to change anything in Susie's bedroom, Lynn says, \"You have a tomb in the middle of your house!\" In a way, that's true of all the Salmons. With Susie gone, they have a tumor in their collective heart. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The movie is packed with privileged moments. A few are grimly comic, like the interior decoration of Mr. Harvey's subterranean playroom; his choices of teen artifacts are both pathetically out of date and a window into a life of outsider lunacy. And some moments have the most poignant tang. From the in-between, Susie has a glimpse of Lindsey's first kiss  an ecstasy Susie was so close to experiencing before she entered Mr. Harvey's lair, that she hopes she can feel for real before she goes to heaven. (Read a book review of The Lovely Bones.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tucci plays the killer not with a madman's sneers and cackles but with a quiet malevolence; he's never more ice-shivery than when he's pretending to be normal. Such a performance could have upset the movie's balance if Wahlberg hadn't provided the solid foundation of parental devotion. The center, of course, is Ronan, the Irish teen best remembered as the girl whose lie set lives tumbling in Atonement. As the dead girl hovering over her family like a guardian angel, Ronan makes Susie seem an ordinary child whom catastrophe has made otherworldly-wise. Through Jackson's art and Ronan's magic, the obscenity of child murder has been invested with immense gravity and grace. Like the story of Susie's life after death, that's a miracle.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next Invictus\nPassage 3:\nA dead 14-year-old girl named Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), murdered on her way home from school in 1973, tells her story from heaven in The Lovely Bones. In doing so, Susie follows the narrative path set for her in the striking 2002 novel by Alice Sebold on which this much-awaited adaptation by Peter Jackson is based. But as directed by the lord of The Lord of the Rings from a screenplay by Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens, his bleached Bones bears little resemblance to the book in either tone or complexity. Readers will be frustrated; newcomers to the story may wonder why what is now essentially a serial-killer thriller includes so many scenes of a heaven that looks like a gumdrop-colored hobbit shire, a magical place of fanciful special effects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Jackson's simplified, sweetened, and CGI-besotted telling, The Lovely Bones is a sad-but-hopeful, dramatic-but-gentle fairy tale intentionally made less upsetting for teens. (There's no indication that Susie gets raped, as she does in the novel, and her murder occurs off screen.) Atonement's terrific Ronan, with her astonishing glacier-blue eyes, watches from a scenic afterlife as her father (Mark Wahlberg), mother (Rachel Weisz), younger siblings, and selected friends simultaneously heal from their loss and search for her killer. For comic relief, the family's boozy granny (Susan Sarandon) arrives, swathed in mink. Apparently participating in a burlesque movie, Sarandon camps it up, demonstrating terrible housekeeping skills and wreaking grande-dame havoc. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for the killer, he's in plain sight from the beginning  a creepy neighbor (Stanley Tucci) with the hopeless comb-over and furtive mustache of an easy-to-spot perv. Tucci is jolting in the role, honestly unsettling as he maintains an exterior of mildness that masks a grotesque interior. Electrifying danger accompanies his every scene. But this in itself becomes a problem, as that same energy leaves the screen when he does. Jackson reduces his Lovely Bones, in the end, to the dramatic contrast between the menace of a hateful killer (will he be caught?) and the grief of a loving father (can he avenge his daughter's death?). Sebold's Lovely Bones, on the other hand, is fleshed out with the perilous, irresistible power of sex  the author acknowledges a real world of extramarital sex and sex between young lovers in addition to the heinous rape from which moviegoers are shielded. The filmmaker handled the sexual power of girls beautifully in 1994's Heavenly Creatures. But here he shies from the challenge, shortchanging a story that isn't only about the lightness of souls in heaven but also about the urges of bodies on earth. Jackson forfeits depth for safe, surface loveliness.

TRAILER: Get a taste of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the bestselling book Alice Sebold's best-selling The Lovely Bones falls into that category. The novel, told from the perspective of a murdered 14-year-old girl, is chilling and poetic. It can't have been easy to adapt because of its reliance on the musings of a dead, omniscient narrator. But a device that works on the page comes off artificial and emotionless on-screen. The movie strikes clashing tones, veering from lightheartedness to heavy-handedness. It's hard not to have high expectations of director Peter Jackson after TheLord of the Rings. And given his haunting Heavenly Creatures (1994), about teenagers and murder, he would seem the right filmmaker to adapt this book. But the scenes that take place in an alternate universe — a way station between heaven and Earth — are jarring. Depicting heaven has long stymied directors, and Jackson's cheesy computer-generated world breaks no ground. Saoirse Ronan (Atonement) is well-cast as the wide-eyed Susie Salmon, who has a passion for photography, loving parents (Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz) and a crush on a high school senior (Reese Ritchie). Walking home from school, Susie is lured into an underground lair by the nebbishy George Harvey (Stanley Tucci). Tucci gives a nightmare-inducing performance as the neighbor whose pleasantries are almost as scary as his violent predilections. Jackson gets the thriller scenes right. He sets up a tense sequence in which a detective (Michael Imperioli) and Harvey eye each other through the windows of a dollhouse. Susie's sister, Lindsey (Rose McIver), is suspicious and sneaks into Harvey's house to find evidence in a suspenseful episode. But the conceit of Susie trapped in a DayGlo world between the one she left and her final resting place, imparting lessons on coping with death, feels preachy. It's more moving when she utters simply: \"I was here for a moment, and then I was gone.\" Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PALMARITO, Mexico (AP) — A video released by Mexican media outlets Wednesday appears to show a soldier executing a civilian lying face down in the street with a shot to the back of his head. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video's circulation was quickly followed by condemnation and pledges from the defense department to determine its authenticity and the Attorney General's Office to investigate the May 3 events in the town of Palmarito. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But late Wednesday, the gritty intersection showed no signs of any investigation. Bullet-pocked facades and windows and the reluctance of residents to talk were the only indications anything occurred. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The security camera footage first published by Diario Cambio purportedly depicts part of the military's encounter with fuel pipeline thieves that the government said left 10 dead in the central state of Puebla. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fuel theft has long plagued Mexico, but is generating more violence lately as federal authorities crack down. Mexico's treasury secretary said Tuesday the practice costs the country $780 million to $1 billion each year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The military originally said that in the May 3 encounter the thieves used local residents as human shields in an initial ambush on an army patrol. Two soldiers were killed and a third wounded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reinforcements of 1,000 soldiers and police were sent in and hours later another patrol was ambushed. Two more soldiers were killed along with three attackers. Puebla state officials later said three more attackers had also died. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is unclear if one of those events is depicted in the video released Wednesday. The Associated Press could not independently verify the video's authenticity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The heavily edited video captured by a security camera shows a silver four-door car slowly reversing into the frame on a darkened street with gunshots hitting it and marks already visible on its windshield. At least one shot appears to come from the rear door on the driver's side, which is ajar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We were there watching TV and suddenly you heard like collisions,\" said a man who lives at the intersection where the shootout occurred. He gave only his first name, Joaquin, saying he feared repercussions if his identity was revealed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said there was a lot shouting from various voices and he could hear vehicles reversing and advancing, then shooting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"All you could do was listen because we couldn't go out because it sounded really bad, the shots,\" he said Wednesday. By the next morning, the camera that had been on a utility pole was gone, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the video's time stamp, soldiers advanced by foot on the car about eight minutes after it stopped, but what happened in the intervening minutes is not shown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The video shows the driver's door opening and a man stepping out with his back to the camera. At the same time, a second man exits from the rear door on the driver's side and lies down in the street. The driver is briefly illuminated as he steps through the beam of the tail light, then two soldiers rush in from the darkness and the driver quickly gets on the ground beside the other man. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A minute later, a soldier pushes a third man from around the back to the front of the car and out of the frame. Seconds later, the man who had gotten out of the back of the vehicle emerges from the darkness and is pushed by a soldier out of the frame in the same direction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then a soldier grabs the arms of the apparent driver and another soldier takes his legs, and they drag him toward the car's front and deposit him on his back. With apparent difficulty, he rolls over onto his stomach. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Six minutes later, the driver remains face down in the street as a soldier holds a rifle in the foreground and two other soldiers stand near the car. Suddenly, a gun and helmet enter the left edge of the frame directly over the unmoving driver and there is a flash from the gun. The man's prone body bucks and the soldier in the foreground lifts up one foot as if surprised by the sound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whatever happened next is not seen. The remainder of the video does not include a time stamp, but a narrator says more than 1½ hours has passed. The man's body remains in the street and soldiers walk toward the camera and the image suddenly jerks and goes white. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The military's statement Wednesday said the video shows soldiers coming under fire and capturing suspects. It said the video apparently also shows a soldier shooting a man while in custody. That incident must be \"irrefutably\" cleared up by federal investigators, it said, adding: \"Under no circumstances can conduct contrary to the law and human rights be justified.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Mexican National Human Rights Commission said it has a copy of the video and other recordings of the encounter. It said the gravity of the events demand a swift and thorough investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Mexican military has been implicated in extrajudicial killings before, including the killing of 22 suspects at a warehouse in the Mexico state community of Tlatlaya. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After investigating that June 30, 2014, incident, the rights commission said soldiers executed at least a dozen suspects after they surrendered. The military had said that all died in a gunfight in which only one soldier was wounded, but the AP found evidence at the scene that contradicted that version.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ministry said in a statement that prosecutors should “comprehensively clear up” whether the video indeed showed the soldier shooting the detained man after a clash last week between security forces and suspected criminals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Published online, the video shows a shot-up car coming to a halt, coming under further gunfire and eventually being surrounded by soldiers. Minutes later, its doors open and people exiting the vehicle are forced onto the ground in a dimly lit area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soon afterward, soldiers drag a man who appears to be still alive from the dark area to a well-lit part of the shot, where he lies on the ground for about six minutes before a soldier steps toward him and appears to shoot him in the back of the head. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A dark stain then spreads outward from the prone man’s head on the asphalt as soldiers move around. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the videos posted online and Mexican media, the events took place during a clash between soldiers and suspected oil thieves in Palmarito in the central state of Puebla last week, in which four soldiers and six suspected criminals died.

It pledged to cooperate with the attorney general’s office in the investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two shootouts between federal security forces and suspected gang members in 2014 and 2015 that took more than 60 lives prompted accusations by human rights groups that federal forces had carried out extrajudicial killings.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group “Truckers for the Constitution” is hoping to call attention to its frustration with regulations from the Obama administration and the overall political climate in the U.S. with an appeal that echoes the early rhetoric of the Tea Party. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Independent Truckers of America are essentially operating on extremely low; and in most cases working below minimum wage, and all paying exorbitant fuel costs and fees,” the group said on its website, RideForTheConstitution.org. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “American truckers are also very politically astute and great patriots, they are all well aware of what is happening to our U.S. Constitution,” the website continued. “Through this campaign, they are leading the convoy of all Americans coast-to-coast who wish to restore our constitutional republic.

Additionally, they are unhappy with reports the U.S. government was spying on American citizens earlier this year and the amount of debt the country has.The group framed its decision to protest by backing up the 64-mile Capital Beltway as a necessity to get the attention of lawmakers.“All Americans are frustrated with the lawlessness of our congressman and senators who refuse to work on behalf of the American people,” the truck driver group said on its website. “It has become apparent that our elected officials will never respond to the will of the people as long as their greed wealth is not jeopardized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The only thing that motivates every politician is their money — cutting off their money-flow cuts off their life-blood. The Independent Truckers in the United States essentially keep commerce flowing for benefit of the central government.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like the initial rise of the Tea Party in 2009, the truck drivers cast their protest in stark terms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The only way to get our legislators to operate lawfully and constitutionally is to penalize them with a credible threat of a shutdown,” the group said. “Through this effort, the American people can demand that all congressmen and senators sign on to the demands for them to operate lawfully and Constitutionally, or risk a possible shutdown if they refuse to follow the law; the supreme law of the land; the U.S. Constitution.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The flyer the truck drivers are distributing for their planned protest names President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and Sens.

Read the latest news about the protest here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ------ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This story was originally posted at 1:47 p.m. Monday: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tractor-trailer drivers will intentionally clog the inner loop of the Washington, D.C., beltway beginning on the morning of Oct. 11, according to a coordinator of the upcoming \"Truckers Ride for the Constitution\" rally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Organizers of the three-day ride want to call attention to a litany of trucker frustrations and express their disapproval of national political leaders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earl Conlon, a Georgia trucker who is handling logistics for the protest, told U.S. News tractor-trailer drivers will circle the beltway \"three lanes deep\" as he rides with other participants to Congress to seek the arrest of congressmen for allegedly disregarding the Constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The truckers circling I-495 will keep the left lane open for emergency vehicles, Conlon said, but \"everybody that doesn't have a supporter sticker on their window, good luck: Nobody in, nobody out.\" The trucks will be going the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR D.C. commuters who wish to be allowed past the convoy must have \"T2SDA\" – an acronym for the event's original name, \"Truckers to Shut Down America\" – written on their vehicle, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's going to be real fun for anyone who is not a supporter,\" Conlon said, \"[and] if cops decide to give us a hard time, we're going to lock the brakes up, we're going to stop right there, we're going to be a three lane roadblock.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zeeda Andrews, a former country music singer helping promote the protest, said last week participants would present demands to congressmen – including the impeachment of President Barack Obama – and give the congressmen an opportunity to agree to the demands in exchange for canceling the ride. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Conlon says that's not quite right. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are not going to ask for impeachment,\" Conlon said. \"We are coming whether they like it or not. We're not asking for impeachment, we're asking for the arrest of everyone in government who has violated their oath of office.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conlon cited the idea of a citizens grand jury – meaning a pool of jurors convened without court approval – as the mechanism for indicting the officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We want these people arrested, and we're coming in with the grand jury to do it,\" he said. \"We are going to ask the law enforcement to uphold their constitutional oath and make these arrests. If they refuse to do it, by the power of the people of the United States and the people's grand jury, they don't want to do it, we will. ... We the people will find a way.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's almost certain that anyone attempting to \"arrest\" a member of Congress would be arrested themselves for attempted kidnapping. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conlon and Andrews say Obama committed \"treason\" by allegedly funneling weapons to al-Qaida-linked rebels in Syria. Members of Congress who support arming Syrian rebels, Conlon said, are accessories to the alleged crime. He identified House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., as politicians he will seek to arrest for alleged acts against the Constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Andrews said last week 3,000 truckers had RSVP-ed to the event, and Conlon says he's now lost count of the number. He says he's receiving around 100 emails a day from prospective participants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What we want to do is go in nice and peaceful and keep it as peaceful as possible... but if they decide to get ugly with us we're going to do what we have to do,\" he said. \"If all I get is one or two congressmen walked out of there in handcuffs, that will be a shot across the bow that will ripple across all branches of government. ... I hope they are all civil enough and brave enough to step out onto the congressional steps.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trucker-specific grievances behind the protest include Environmental Protection Agency fuel efficiency standards and the high cost of diesel fuel. State and local anti-idling laws as well as insurance companies purportedly requiring technological updates are among the irritations, as is the perceived deterioration of Fourth Amendment rights protecting truckers' cabs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether or not the truckers pack a punch to D.C. area traffic depends on the number and intensity level of participants. A similar three-day protest in 2007, against illegal immigration and competition from Mexican truckers, did not spoil commutes as feared, the Washington Examiner reported.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I wouldn't be surprised if you saw more dismissals and more being forced out sooner rather than later,\" said King, who is being updated on the investigation by Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan. \"You may see a few more today or tomorrow.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Chuck Grassley, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he thought more people would be fired within \"just a few days.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"`I expect there will be more, but that's what the investigation is all about.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three U.S. military officials have said the military personnel include five Army Green Berets, two Navy Explosive Ordinance Disposal technicians, two Marine dog handlers and an Air Force airman. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still under way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An Air Force colonel and a military lawyer have gone to Colombia as part of the military investigation. The Secret Service probe has included interviews with the employees and hotel staff. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR King said investigators in Colombia have not been able to interview the women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A 24-year-old prostitute told The New York Times this week that the scandal became public after she fought over payment with one of the Secret Service employees, and it spilled out into the hallway of the Hotel Caribe on April 12. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jose Pena, a Cartagena taxi driver, told The Associated Press that he picked up the woman after the dispute. She said she left the hotel, where other members of the security detail and the White House press corps were staying, after she was paid $225. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Cartagena this week, sex workers and hotel staff were reluctant to speak about the incident, which has become an election year embarrassment in the U.S. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prostitution is legal in Colombia, and Cartagena thrives on the sex tourism industry, Mayor Campo Elias readily acknowledged, with hundreds of prostitutes available on any given night throughout the colonial walled city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Washington, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who said she had not been briefed, called the incident \"disgusting.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There has to be an investigation to see how this could have happened, and those responsible should have to pay a price,\" Pelosi said. \"But as with all these things, there are many people in the Secret Service who do their job responsibly, and we can't paint everyone with the same brush. But nonetheless, those people who were responsible have brought disgrace and it's disgusting.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican, called for leadership changes at the Secret Service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I mentioned before, and I can't get a better analogy than baseball. You get three strikes,\" Forbes said. \"They went over their budgets, they couldn't control their budget. They couldn't control who got in the White House. And now we're talking about just absolutely a fundamental principle of security planning _ you don't let the prostitutes in.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada suggested the problem lies with the judgment of those involved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Understand this, there is not a committee hearing that's going to take the place or stop people from being stupid. There is not a bill we can pass to cause people to have common sense,\" Reid said. \"Think about this. People that are here to protect the president, they go to Colombia and have a fight with a prostitute over how much she should be paid. That's either very stupid or a total lack of common sense.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another Republican lawmaker said Thursday that the Secret Service incident raised questions about whether Obama was capably leading the government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't sense that this president has shown that kind of managerial leadership,\" said Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During his daily briefing, Carney shot back: \"That sounds very much like a lawmaker attempting to politicize something that is not at all political.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman, Jim Abrams, Julie Pace, Larry Margasak, Ken Thomas and Eileen Sullivan in Washington, Brian Witte in Annapolis, Md., Denise Lavoie in Boston and Frank Bajak in Cartagena, Colombia, contributed to this report.\nPassage 2:\nOne of the Secret Service supervisors ousted from the agency this week for their involvement in the Colombia prostitution scandal made light of his official protective work on his Facebook page, joking about a picture of himself standing watch behind Sarah Palin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR David Randall Chaney, 48, posted several shots of himself on duty in a dark suit and sunglasses, including one that shows him behind the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee during that campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was really checking her out, if you know what i mean?” Chaney wrote in the comments section after friends had marveled at the photo. He is married and has an adult son. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chaney, who had been a supervisor in the Secret Service’s international programs division, retired under pressure Wednesday, according to people familiar with an internal agency investigation into the allegations that 11 agents and uniformed officers participated in a night of carousing April 11 ahead of President Obama’s visit to the Summit of the Americas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was one of two senior supervisors who are accused in the scandal, which investigators believe included heavy drinking, visits to a strip club and payments to women working as prostitutes. Several people familiar with the matter have identified the other supervisor as Greg Stokes, who was assistant special agent in charge of the K-9 division. Stokes has been notified by agency officials that he will be fired, although he will be given an opportunity to contest the charges, those with knowledge of the case said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The disclosure that two high-level managers were involved in the misconduct has raised questions of accountability and personal conduct in an agency whose top leadership has insisted that the Cartagena incident is an isolated and aberrant case, not a sign of a deeper cultural problem within the institution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chaney and Stokes have each worked at the Secret Service for nearly two decades, and both have served significant time with the presidential protection detail, people who know the men said. Both are based in Washington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The supervisors were sent on the trip to supervise dozens of younger, less-experienced agents who were part of the advance team preparing for Obama’s arrival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lawrence Berger, the general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association and an attorney for Chaney and Stokes, declined to comment on details of the allegations involving his clients. He said the agency’s investigation is not complete for either man and stressed that any judgment about their roles in the scandal is “premature.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s our ultimate position that nothing they may or may not have done in Colombia negatively impacted the efficiency of their mission,” Berger said. “Nothing that has been reported to have been done has impacted negatively their mission or the president’s visit.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Members of Congress who have been briefed on the matter have said 21 men are suspected of bringing as many as 21 prostitutes to their rooms. Ten military personnel also have been accused of participating, along with the 11 Secret Service members. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incident became public after one man got into a dispute over payment with a woman on the morning of April 12, drawing the attention of hotel staff and Colombian authorities, who reported the matter to the U.S. Embassy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Secret Service recalled its 11 employees and replaced them with another team before Obama arrived April 13. All of the recalled members were placed on administrative leave, and their top-secret security clearances were revoked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Secret Service announced Wednesday that three of the men were being dismissed from the agency for their involvement. The third man is a junior member of the team who has voluntarily elected to resign, those familiar with the investigation said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Berger did not answer questions about his clients’ employment status. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They have a passion for the agency’s mission,” he said. “They’ve both been doing it for over 17 or 18 years, day in and day out, and very well.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, Capitol Hill lawmakers who oversee the Department of Homeland Security — which includes the Secret Service — said they expected more resignations and firings in the case. Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the 11 agents involved in the scandal underwent drug tests and polygraph exams. Agency investigators in Colombia have visited all of the hotels where Secret Service personnel stayed and have interviewed each of the maids who cleaned rooms in the Hotel Caribe, King said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People who know the two ­supervisors have described Chaney’s duties in the international programs division as supervising a department that provides support and administrative help to the agency’s foreign of­fices. Stokes has been described as the assistant special agent in charge of the K-9 training division at the James J. Rowley Training Center in Beltsville. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Attempts to reach both men were unsuccessful. Calls made to Chaney’s home and cellphone and to Stokes’s home were not returned. No one answered the door when a reporter visited Chaney’s home in Northern Virginia. Parked outside was a silver Ford pickup truck, bearing stickers with a colorful outline of Texas, Chaney’s home state, and the mantra “SECEDE.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A relative of Chaney said she would relay a message to him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The commitment to the Secret Service runs deep in Chaney’s family. His father, George Washington Chaney, was a Secret Service agent in President John F. Kennedy’s era and knew the agents on his detail when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The elder Chaney had remarked to friends that he started at the service working “diaper duty,” where he watched President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s children and grandchildren in Gettysburg, Pa., and also met his wife. Later, he traveled to work in Dallas, where he was on President Lyndon B. Johnson’s protective detail. He also served a stint in the service’s El Paso office and then became the agent in charge of personnel in the D.C. headquarters, where he was working when Kennedy was shot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He retired in 1977 and started a new line of work as a document examiner in Dallas, where he and his wife raised their five children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On David Chaney’s Facebook page, he posted several shots of himself with Palin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In one picture, he is wearing a dark suit and sunglasses, standing near a black vehicle behind Palin as she approaches a crowd. In the comments section next to the photo, a friend remarked that Chaney appeared to be “lurking in the shadows” behind Palin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another kidded that there seemed to be “real chemistry” between the two. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chaney posted: “I was really checking her out, if you know what i mean?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another friend asked if one of the buttons on Palin’s lapel was emblazoned with Chaney’s face. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chaney replied, “well if it was could you blame her, anything to satisfy a stalker.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In another set of Facebook photos, Chaney documents a trip he took with his grown son to Egypt. One photo shows a voluptuous belly dancer in a revealing bikini-like top and tight, sequined skirt positioned between him and his son. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Not in front of my son,” Chaney joked in the comments section. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Fox News Thursday night, Palin responded to the Post’s revelations about Chaney’s comments by saying she was disgusted that a Secret Service agent would make jokes about checking out her “backside” and called his behavior “pretty embarrassing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This agent . . . was kind of ridiculous posting pictures and comments,” she said. “Well check this out, bodyguard. You’re fired! And I hope his wife . . . kicks him into the dog house.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Palin stressed she viewed the scandal as emblematic of Obama’s poor management. “Look who’s running the show,” she said. “People will say its boys being boys. I’ve had enough of these men being dogs and not being responsible for the taxpayer’s dollars.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fox News host Greta Van Susteren told Palin she agreed Obama should be held accountable for how he reacted to the incident but stressed that the agent made his comments about Palin under the Bush administration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One current agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation, said both Chaney and Stokes were respected, well-liked agents and supervisors, who were both quick to offer advice and mentor younger agents and officers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was just completely shocked to hear they were involved,” the agent said.

Fired in late July 2017, less than two weeks after his appointment, the White House’s official reason for releasing Scaramucci was to give its new Chief of Staff, General John Kelly, a clean slate. Scaramucci’s tenure in Trump’s cabinet was tumultuous despite being short. The highlights included apparent protocol breaches with the FBI, conflicting statements about his relationship with then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and a profanity laced interview with The New Yorker, in which he spoke ill of several other Trump administration officials, including Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. In the midst of his brief stint in the White House, Scaramucci’s wife filed for divorce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Source: Gage Skidmore / Flickr NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2.

It’s not hard to see why. The lame duck two-term governor fawned over Donald Trump after the bombastic billionaire won the presidential election. Many speculated Christie was angling for a post in the new administration. Trump did name Christie to head his transition team, but eventually replaced him with Mike Pence. In the end, Trump decided not to include Christie in his cabinet, possibly because Christie was damaged goods. Indeed, Christie’s reputation was sullied by the Bridgegate scandal in which allies created a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge in early September 2013, hoping motorists would blame a local Democratic mayor for the tie-up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The outgoing governor said he does not care about poll numbers.

Comey garnered even more ire when, in an apparent break with bureau protocol, he announced candidate Clinton was the subject of an FBI investigation only days before the election. While some attribute President Donald Trump’s electoral victory to Comey’s investigation of Clinton, Trump abruptly fired the FBI Director less than five months into his presidency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comey had served as FBI Director since 2013, when he was appointment by President Barack Obama, until he was terminated by Trump in May 2017.

Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure as CEO — even as corporate revenue climbed over 5% from 2014 to 2016. Shareholder confidence was mostly undermined by Fields’ determination to take on Tesla, investing in electric and autonomous vehicle technology.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nGetty Images House Speaker John Boehner NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congress is working through the weekend to resolve a standoff that could prompt a government shutdown next week. Here’s a look at what’s happening, and why, ahead of the Monday night deadline to approve new funding for federal agencies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Q. What are the next steps in Congress to avoid a government shutdown? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A. The House voted early Sunday morning to approve a plan to fund federal agencies through Dec. 15, which would also include conditions related to the new federal health law. Those conditions include delay the start of the health law for one year and repeal the law’s tax on medical devices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Q. Senate Democrats say they will reject any changes to the health law, and President Barack Obama would veto such a bill. Why did House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) move to delay the law? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A. Mr. Boehner has a powerful incentive to continue to press his party’s fight against the health law: Conservatives in the House Republican conference are clamoring for a confrontation over it, and they have the votes to make trouble for Mr. Boehner on this and many other fiscal matters. Mr. Boehner does not want to stand down from a fight too soon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the House eventually accepts a spending bill with no major changes to the health law, Republicans will be unlikely to do so until the last minute. It may even be that a short government shutdown will have to take place to satisfy the conservatives’ desire to show they fought as much as they could. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moreover, Republicans believe there is some chance that the Senate will agree to repeal the medical device tax, giving the House GOP a victory. Test votes earlier this year in the Senate showed broad, bipartisan support for the repeal. However, the leading Democratic proponent of the repeal –Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — has said she does not favor tacking it onto the spending bill. Senate leadership aides say they are confident they have the votes to beat the amendment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans argue that their new proposal to delay the health care law for a year represents a compromise between their earlier efforts to repeal it entirely and Democrats’ desire to make no changes in it for now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Q. What options does the Senate have after the House acts? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A. Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon—close to the midnight deadline for passing legislation to avoid a government shutdown. Democratic leaders could call senators into session on Sunday or earlier on Monday, but aides say they have no plans to do so. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Democrats could receive the bill and then table the amendments to delay the health law and to repeal the medical device tax, which could be achieved with a 51-vote majority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aides do not expect there to be an opportunity for delaying tactics such as a filibuster. But if an opening arises, one lawmaker who has already shown an inclination to use delaying tactics is Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), who has been trying to strip all money for the health care law from the spending bill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Q. What scenarios are there for how this gets resolved? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A. The window is closing on the opportunities for avoiding a government shutdown. The House and Senate could agree to a compromise between now and Monday night, but it is not clear how that would materialize or how it could be passed quickly—especially through the rule-laden Senate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One possibility: Once it becomes clear that the impasse will not be broken by the deadline, the House and Senate could pass a very short-term funding bill—for a week or so—to buy a little more time to reach an agreement. Or, the partial government shutdown could hit, which would then ratchet up pressure on both parties to reach a compromise in the subsequent days.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And so far, Reid is getting his way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Text Size - NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR + NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR reset Heckler at House GOP rally Reid: Won't bow to 'anarchists' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the president considered sitting down with the four congressional leaders in the White House ahead of the deadline to avert a government shutdown, Reid privately urged Obama to call off the meeting, according to several people familiar with the situation. Reid believed that it would amount to nothing more than a photo-op that would give the false impression that a serious negotiation was occurring, even warning he wouldn’t attend such a session. Obama scrapped it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Government shutdown full coverage) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Washington barrels forward to the first government shutdown in 17 years on Tuesday, the wily Reid has taken the lead role in pushing a hardball Democratic legislative strategy that can be summed up like this: Make the Republicans cave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He’s been the rock … and he’s had our whole caucus behind him,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a close Reid ally who spoke with the majority leader nine times on Saturday afternoon. “Because if we negotiate on a short-term [government funding bill], what are [Republicans] going to do on a long-term bill? What are they going to do on the debt ceiling?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far in this fight, the party’s leadership, senior White House officials and the president have been on the same page. They will not let Republicans gut or delay Obamacare — or concede an inch to the GOP despite the ramifications of a shutdown. For now, even Republicans privately concede House Republicans could suffer much of the political backlash for a looming shutdown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Also on POLITICO: Republicans toss insults at Reid) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Reid’s no-compromise stance is not without its own risks. With Washington held in such low regard, politicians of all stripes are certain to incur fury from constituents once government services are suspended, parks are closed and hundreds of thousands of federal workers are furloughed. And Reid now is protecting a fragile Democratic Senate majority, with Republicans just six seats away from returning to power — so any misstep by the Nevada Democrat could hurt vulnerable senators in red states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A shutdown appears a near certainty at this point. After the Senate stripped out language to defund Obamacare in a bill to keep the government running until mid-November, the House in a rare Saturday session added in a yearlong delay of major portions of the health care law and a repeal of the law’s 2.3 percent tax on medical-device makers. On Monday afternoon, Reid will reconvene the Senate and quickly move to kill the House’s anti-Obamacare provisions on the votes of just Democratic senators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At that point, the ball will be back in Speaker John Boehner’s court: Pass a $986-billion continuing resolution that would continue to fund Obamacare, or send back another plan taking aim at the health law that Republicans collectively hate. If they choose the latter, Democrats plan to vote it down in the Senate. And if the House refuses to pass a clean stopgap measure, a partial government shutdown would occur for the first time since the Clinton era. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (PHOTOS: 17 times the government has shut down) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reid said in an interview Friday there was little point for Obama to engage directly in the fiscal fights. “Not on the debt ceiling and not on the CR,” he told POLITICO. “Maybe on something else — but not these two. We have to fund the government and pay our bills.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reid’s strategy boils down to a few factors: If Democrats give even a few small concessions on a short-term stopgap funding measure, Republicans will demand even bigger concessions to avoid a debt default in mid-October. Since Republicans have been engulfed in an intraparty war over how far to take a shutdown threat, Reid and his top lieutenants are convinced that the political backlash from a shutdown would be devastating to the GOP, potentially costing them their majority in the House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (WATCH: Obamacare timeline) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republicans on Sunday furiously sought to change that narrative and put the blame squarely on Reid. About 20 House members rallied in front of the Senate steps on Sunday afternoon, accusing Reid of angling for a government shutdown to hurt Republicans politically. They called on the Senate to come back into session Sunday and negotiate with House Republicans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (WATCH: Romney: There's a better way to stop Obamacare) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The fact that the senators aren’t here and Harry Reid is off somewhere is all the evidence that you need to know that they want to shut down the government,” said Rep. Tim Griffin of Arkansas. “I personally believe that Sen. Reid and the president — for political purposes — want to shut down the government.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether the party can stick together when the political heat intensifies remains to be seen given that Democrats haven’t always been unified in fiscal fights during Obama’s time in office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reid and top Democrats were infuriated by the White House’s handling of the fiscal cliff fight that led to a New Year’s Eve 2012 deal between Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. In late 2010, when the White House cut a deal with Senate Republicans to extend Bush-era tax cuts for two years, Democrats were also furious. And in 2011, Democrats feared Obama would cut a grand-bargain deal with Boehner that would slash too deeply into entitlement programs they have vowed to protect.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that’s not counting the blow to tourism, one of the region’s economic mainstays, if the Smithsonian museums, the National Zoo, Civil War battlefields and other federally funded attractions are shuttered, said Stephen Fuller, director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is serious,” Fuller said. “The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks. But for the Washington area, this is a tsunami.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the economic impact, area residents could also see cuts in federal services: no new applications for benefits such as Medicare, Social Security and child-care subsidies, no new housing or small-business loans, no new clinical trials for research funded by the National Institutes of Health and a murky prognosis for the safety net for those most in need.

Amtrak officials have said trains will continue to run. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And while the District is the only jurisdiction that could have basic services — such as trash pickup and libraries — halted, Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) is attempting to avoid that by declaring every city employee essential, a distinction that could keep them working through a federal shutdown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) has been pushing a bill in Congress to exempt the city from a potential shutdown, as it did in 1995, when a federal shutdown had what Norton called a “disastrous” impact on the District. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It was horrific,” Norton said. “In a shutdown, the garbage does not get picked up, no matter what, for a week. Then you can declare a health emergency.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘We’re really bleeding’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The possible shutdown comes at a time when the region’s economy is weak, said Fuller, the economist. The across-the-board sequestration cuts earlier this year cost the region 26,500 net jobs in August, Fuller said. With furloughs and agencies not filling positions, the $42 billion annual federal payroll is down $2 billion from last year, and federal contracting is down $5 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’re really bleeding,” Fuller said. “A shutdown will have real costs.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fuller, who made his calculations over the weekend thinking that a shutdown would be inevitable, projected that 60 percent of the area’s 377,000 federal workers would be deemed “nonessential” and would stay home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR View Graphic Countdown to the (possible) shutdown NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Likewise, he projected that the shutdown would affect about 20 percent of the government’s contractors, who receive about $75 billion a year from the federal government. And each person furloughed means less money spent at local businesses or vendors, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) said a shutdown would have a disproportionate effect on the Washington region, where the federal government’s presence accounts for one-third of the economy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1995 and 1996 — when a political impasse between President Bill Clinton and a Republican-controlled House led by Speaker Newt Gingrich resulted in the shutdown of the federal government for three weeks — several appropriations bills had already passed. This time, not a single appropriations bill has made it through Congress, so a shutdown could affect every federal agency in some way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Air traffic controllers are considered essential, so planes will fly. But without “nonessential” support staff, those planes could be delayed. Federal benefits may continue to be processed, but with fewer workers to process them, no new applications would be accepted and “serious backlogs” would be expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lawmakers passed legislation to continue paying active military members, but veterans’ benefits could run out if a shutdown lasts more than a few weeks, administration officials have said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Widespread ripple effects NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The ripple effects of a shutdown can be devastating,” Connolly said. “A federal pullback may mean the difference for state and local governments on whether they can continue Meals on Wheels or hire an additional police officer or do more emergency preparedness training. All of this stuff is under the radar, but it’s very critical to the health of our communities.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) is concerned about how a shutdown could affect the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the CIA, the U.S. Marshals Service and other agencies, many of whose employees live in the area. “Congressman Wolf has been saying for weeks that shutting down the government is not a good idea,” said Daniel Scandling, a spokesman for Wolf. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Congressional Research Service, in a recent report, said the 1996 federal government shutdowns shuttered national parks and monuments, stopped the processing of passport applications and the visa applications of foreigners, halted new patient enrollments in clinical trials at the NIH, and delayed work on bankruptcy and delinquent child-support cases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2011, the federal judiciary estimated that it could operate courts for two weeks after a shutdown but that “serious disruptions” would follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The D.C. region could be hit hard by lost income tax revenue from tens of thousands of idled federal workers: Maryland officials estimate the state would lose $5 million a day. Prince George’s County officials say they could lose $270,000 in income tax revenue daily during a shutdown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To stave off such effects, local governments have been setting aside pots of money in anticipation of a shutdown. Montgomery County accounted for a possible $60 million loss in revenue in its current budget. Arlington County set aside $3 million, and Fairfax County has $8 million. Maryland and Virginia officials say they are looking at the possibility of tapping reserve funds.\n", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nRenamed the Parker Solar Probe to honour solar astrophysicist who predicted high speed solar wind, the spacecraft will attempt to get close to sun’s surface NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nasa has announced its hotly anticipated mission to send a spacecraft into the sun’s outer atmosphere has a new name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Formerly known as the Solar Probe Plus mission, the endeavour will now be known as the Parker Solar Probe, honouring the American solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker who predicted a high speed solar wind – the stream of charged particles, or plasma, that flows from the sun out into space. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parker, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago who will turn 90 on 10 June, put forward his theory in 1958. It was initially met with scepticism. “People just thought it was crazy,” said Justin Kasper, a space scientist at the University of Michigan and lead investigator for one of the probe’s scientific research projects. But later observations proved the prediction correct. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Esa’s Solar Orbiter mission passes crucial milestone Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parker’s work delved into a longstanding puzzle. While the temperature at the centre of the sun is about 15mC, further out things get complicated. “One of the mysterious things about our sun’s atmosphere is the [sun’s] surface, which is glowing visible in the yellow and white, is 6,000C, but the corona – its atmosphere – is at 1m-5mC,” said Kasper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incredible temperatures in the corona, Parker realised, would create an unstable situation, meaning the sun’s atmosphere is no longer pulled back by the star’s gravity but instead escapes into space. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Parker said that by a couple of solar radii, the atmosphere would hit the speed of sound, it would break the sound barrier in the sun’s atmosphere, [and] by 10 solar radii it would be going supersonic,” said Kasper. “We enter the space age, and one of the first things we discover is this supersonic solar wind.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With the probe set to investigate the origins of solar wind, including the mysterious heating of the sun’s atmosphere and how the solar wind accelerates to astonishing speeds of up to 400 miles per second, the renaming of the mission is a fitting tribute to Parker. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is not the first time that Nasa has renamed a mission to honour a scientist. In 2008 the space agency renamed the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in honour of the late Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. In 2012, the space agency announced that it was renaming the Radiation Belt Storm Probes in honour of the late James Van Allen. Van Allen discovered two radiation belts composed of charged particles, known as the Van Allen belts, that encircle the Earth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Nasa has never named a spacecraft after a researcher during their lifetime. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to make history,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Nasa science mission directorate, announcing the new name of the mission at the University of Chicago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking at the press conference Nicola Fox, mission project scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, added that a chip would be placed on board the spacecraft carrying pictures of Parker and his scientific papers, as well as a plate with an inscription of his choice. Parker was then presented with a model of the probe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition, Parker was awarded with the Nasa Distinguished Public Service Medal – the highest award from the space agency for non-governmental personnel – in honour of his lifetime’s work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dressed in a black suit and tie, Parker said that he was privileged that the mission had been named after him. “I am greatly honoured to be associated with such a heroic scientific space mission,” he said, explaining that designing a spacecraft to withstand temperatures so close to the sun is a considerable feat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Realising a dream from the beginning of the space age NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The size of a car, shaped like the business end of a torch, and built to withstand temperatures of more than 1400C (2552F), the newly named Parker Solar Probe is set to be launched next summer in an unprecedented attempted to get up close to our star, coming within 4m miles of its surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It is just extraordinary - it is something that people have wanted to do from the beginning of the space age,” said Tim Horbury, professor of physics at Imperial College London. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientist say the mission, costing in the region of $1.5bn, could radically change our understanding of the sun, while offering vital insights into space weather - phenomena including coronal mass ejections that trigger geomagnetic storms that not only damage satellite systems but can knock out power grids on Earth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It is just a hugely important and scientifically fascinating mission,” said David McComas, vice president of the Princeton University plasma physics laboratory and principal investigator for the probe’s “Integrated Science Investigation of the sun”, research that will probe how electrons, protons and other charged particles are accelerated in the sun’s atmosphere. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facebook Twitter Pinterest An artist’s impression of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft approaching the sun. Photograph: Johns Hopkins University Applied/PA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It is far closer than anything ever built by humanity has ever gotten to the sun,” McComas said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instruments for a number of scientific investigations on board the spacecraft will probe myriad solar phenomena from the electric and magnetic properties of the sun’s plasma to counting and catching the components of solar wind. The latter, a project dubbed the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons Investigation, is led by Kasper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The sun is obviously very hot – its outer atmosphere is at hundreds of thousands of degrees Kelvin, and as a result it blows a bubble into interstellar space,” said Horbury. “We live in that bubble, we live in the heliosphere, and it is the solar wind that blows that bubble.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The goal of the probe is to understand how the sun makes the solar wind, and explore the physical process that are occurring. A member of the science team for the probe’s Fields instrument, Horbury plans to study turbulence within the solar wind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When we first started [looking at the sun from space] that we realised the sun is not a boring yellow sphere, it is an incredibly dynamic, active plasma object,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the challenges have been immense, Horbury adds, describing the mission as “just on the edge of achievable”. The major difficulty was designing the probe to prevent it being toasted by the sun’s immense heat - as part of the solution the probe boasts a large heat-shield that is actively cooled by radiator systems. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There is a tiny spacecraft cowering behind this big heat shield,” Horbury said. “It is just extreme - everything is different when you are that close in [to the sun].” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Parker Solar Probe will travel far closer to the sun that any previous probe. While 4m miles might sound like a sizeable distance from the sun, it corresponds to under 10 solar radii. “[The Earth is] about 250-odd solar radii away, so it is really close,” said Horbury. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The distance is crucial. Solar wind accelerates away from the sun, but it is about 10 solar radii that it effectively goes supersonic. “The point about the probe is it is going to get within that critical point,” said Hornbury. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McComas’s part of the mission will explore in detail how certain particles, ejected by events including coronal mass ejections but not part of the solar wind, end up with very high energies, travelling at speeds of up to 80% of the speed of light. “They are really interesting and important particles because, for example, they can cause radiation damage in space to spacecraft, they can be a threat to astronauts in space,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mission is not only expected to offer unprecedented insights into the physics of the sun – an endeavour that will shed light on processes happening in stars across the universe – but will also yield vital information about space weather, that could help scientists to predict major events before they affect Earth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The stakes for the mission are high, admits Horbury. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The thing about space is everyone has done the easy stuff – we are only left with the difficult things, so by definition this is risky,” he said. “They are really pushing the limits of what is possible. But that is the way you make progress.”\nPassage 2:\nNASA is naming its upcoming mission to “touch the Sun” after Eugene Parker, a prominent astrophysicist who discovered the existence of solar wind — the charged particles that are constantly streaming from our star. The mission, originally named Solar Probe Plus, will now be called the Parker Solar Probe. It’s the first time NASA has named one of its missions after a scientist who is still alive. Parker discovered solar wind in the 1950s and is about to celebrate his 90th birthday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Parker Solar Probe is NASA’s plan to send a spacecraft closer to our Sun than ever before. The probe, which is being developed by Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, is supposed to launch on top of a Delta IV Heavy rocket in either July or August of 2018 and then spend seven years getting into closer and closer orbits around the Sun. To do this, the vehicle will do seven flybys of Venus, which will eventually bring the spacecraft within 3.7 million miles of the Sun. That’s about eight times closer than any other spacecraft has been before, according to NASA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA’s plan to send a spacecraft closer to our Sun than ever before NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From this distance, the Parker Solar Probe will analyze the Sun’s atmosphere, mainly to figure out the mechanics of the solar wind that Parker discovered. The Sun is constantly spewing out highly charged particles in the form of plasma — what is known as solar wind. And it’s all thanks to the Sun’s outer atmosphere, or the corona. Even though the corona extends millions of miles out into space, it is unbelievably hot — so hot that it heats up particles to such extreme temperatures that they break free of the Sun’s gravity and accelerate outward in all directions. This solar wind, which carries part of the Sun’s magnetic field, travels all the way to Earth and slams into our planet’s own magnetic field. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fortunately, our field acts like a protective barrier, so usually this process is pretty harmless for us. But every now and then, the Sun burps out an extra helping of charged particles known as a coronal mass ejection. When this mess of particles reaches Earth, it can disturb our magnetic field enough to cause geomagnetic storms. These storms aren’t too serious, but they can mess with our power grids and communications systems, as well as damage our satellites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We know the basics of how solar wind works, but the processes behind these particle bursts are still not totally understood. That’s what the Parker Solar Probe is going to help us figure out. The spacecraft is designed to “trace the flow of energy” that’s responsible for heating up the corona and accelerating the solar wind. And the more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Normally, NASA waits to rename its missions after launch, but the space agency decided to break protocol this time since Parker’s work has been so instrumental for the spacecraft’s mission. His discovery of solar wind has essentially changed our understanding of stars and how they interact with the space around them. Apart from getting the mission named after him, a chip with pictures of Parker will also be included on the vehicles, as well as a copy of his original paper on solar wind.\nPassage 3:\nBelow is the uncorrected machine-read text of this chapter, intended to provide our own search engines and external engines with highly rich, chapter-representative searchable text of each book.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EXTENDED SUMMARY THE IMPACT OF SPACE WEATHER Modern technological society is characterized by a complex interweave of dependencies and interdependencies among its critical infrastructures. A complete picture of the socioeconomic impact of severe space weather must include both direct, industry-specific effects (such as power outages and spacecraft anomalies) and the collateral effects of space-weather-driven technology failures on dependent infrastructures and services. Industry-Specific Space Weather Impacts The electric power, spacecraft, and aviation industries are the main industries whose opera- tions can be adversely affected by severe space weather. The effects of space weather can also be experienced by the growing number of users of the Global Positioning System (GPS) such as the oil and gas industry, which relies on GPS positioning data to support offshore drilling operations. Electric Power Industry During intense geomagnetic storms, the auroral oval moves to lower, more densely populated latitudes, where rapidly varying ionospheric currents associated with the aurora can produce direct-current flows in the electrical power grid. Such geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can overload the grid, causing severe voltage regulation problems and, potentially, widespread power outages. Moreover, GICs can cause intense internal heating in extra-high-voltage (EHV) transformers, putting them at risk of failure or even permanent damage. The March 1989 Quebec blackout referred to above remains the classic example of the impact of a severe space weather eventâthe most intense storm of the space age1âon the electric power industry. Storm-related GICs caused a voltage depression in the Hydro-QuÃ©bec grid that Hydro-QuÃ©becâs automatic voltage compensation equipment could not mitigate, resulting in a precipitous voltage collapse over a wide area. Specifically, five transmission lines from the James Bay hydroelectric power generation stations were tripped, causing a generation loss of 9,450 MW. With a load of about 21,350 MW, the system was unable to withstand the loss and collapsed within a minute and a half, blacking out the province of Quebec for approximately 9 hours. The effects of the storm were felt in the United States as well, in the Northeast, the upper-Midwest, the mid-Atlantic region, and even as far south as southern California. Approximately 200 storm- related events were reported to have affected power systems in North America; of these events the most severe was the failure of a large step-up transformer at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant in New Jersey. Other events ranged from generators tripping out of service, to voltage swings at major substations, to other, lesser equipment failures. Following the 1989 collapse of the Hydro-QuÃ©bec grid, electric power companies developed operational procedures to protect power grids against disruption and damage by severe space weather. Grid operators receive space weather forecasts from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and from commercial and other space weather services. They also monitor voltages and ground currents in real time. During the geomagnetic storms of October and November 2003, for example, power grid opera- NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EXTENDED SUMMARY tors in New England responded to severe space weather alerts and to real-time data from GIC monitors by modifying power grid operations in order to maintain adequate power quality for customers and reserve capacity to counteract the effects of the storms. Despite severe GICs, the power transmission equipment was protected, and the grid maintained continuous operation. Spacecraft Operations In late October 2003, powerful solar flares and fast Earthward-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originating in an unusually large sunspot region (see p. 2) triggered especially intense geo- magnetic and radiation storms during which more than half the spacecraft anomalies reported for that year occurred (Figure 1). The impact of space weather on spacecraft systems is not limited to dramatic CME-driven space weather events such as the 2003 âHalloweenâ storms and the March 1989 storm. Of major concern to the spacecraft industry are the periodic enhancements of the magnetospheric energetic electron environment associated with high-speed solar wind streams emanating from coronal holes during the declining phase of the solar cycle as well the injection of energetic plasma into the inner magnetosphere during magnetic substorms, which can occur during nonstorm times as well as storm times. The effect of space weather on spacecraft operations is illustrated by the outage in January 1994 of two Canadian telecommunications satellites in geostationary orbit.2 On January 20, 1994, Telesatâs Anik E1 was disabled for about 7 hours as a result of damage to its control electronics by the discharge of electric charge deposited in the interior of the spacecraft by penetrating high- energy electrons. The outage occurred during an energetic electron storm that had begun a week earlier as a high-speed solar wind stream swept past Earth. During the E1 outage, the Canadian press was unable to deliver news to 100 newspapers and 450 radio stations. In addition, tele- phone service to 40 communities was interrupted. Shortly after E1 was restored to service, its sister satellite, Anik E2, went off the air, resulting in the loss of television and data services to more than 1,600 remote communities. Backup systems were also damaged, making the $290 million satellite useless. Approximately 100,000 home satellite dish owners were required to re-point their dishes manually to E1 and other satellites. It took Telesat operators 6 months to restore Anik E2 to service. The E2 failure is estimated to have cost Telesat $50 million to $70 million (U.S. dollars) in recovery costs and lost business. The principal cause of space-weather-related spacecraft anomalies and failures is radiation in the form of solar energetic particles, galactic cosmic rays, and energetic particles trapped within Earthâs radiation belts or accelerated during magnetospheric substorms. In order to design spacecraft that can withstand the effects of continuous exposure to space radiation and operate 24/7 for 10 to 15 years, spacecraft designers need accurate long-term models of the radiation environment and information about the statistical distribution of extreme events (e.g., the space weather equivalent of the â100-year stormâ). Designers are thus concerned primarily with space climatology rather than with specific space weather events. Spacecraft operators, however, require real-time knowledge of the space environment as well as short-term forecasts (ânowcastsâ) in order to make operational decisions (e.g., with respect to thruster firing to reposition a spacecraft) that can reduce risks to spacecraft during disturbed conditions. (Such information is also used to support launch go/no-go decisions.) In the event of a spacecraft anomaly, knowledge of the NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EXTENDED SUMMARY 70 Average # of events/yr = 24.3 Average # of failures/yr = 2.5 60 Most events/failures are not attributed to space weather, but 46 of 70 in 2003 occurred during Halloween storms 50 Number of Reports 40 30 Ave Events 20 Events SC Failures 10 Ave Failures 0 1993* 1994* 1995* 1996* 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Figure 1. Telecommunication satellite anomalies and failures over a 14-year period. (Data for the years 1993-1996 2.9 Bodeau.eps are less extensive than for the period from 1997 on). The annual probability of an anomaly is around 10 percent, and the annual probability of a failure is about 1 percent. The big spike in 2003 reflects the anomalies that oc- curred during the October-November 2003 âHalloweenâ storms, which did not produce a significant rise in satellite failures. Around 250 commercial telecommunications satellites are operating in geosynchronous orbit. At a cost of roughly $300 million each, this fleet represents a $75 billion investment and generates an estimated annual revenue stream of more than $250 billion ($100 million per satellite per year). (Image courtesy of Michael Bodeau, Northrop Grumman.) environment where the anomaly occurred as well as climatological information helps operators determine whether or not the anomaly was caused by space weather. Airline Operations In the late 1990s, airline companies began to fly polar routes between North America and Asia in order to avoid strong wintertime headwinds and thus to reduce travel time (Figure 2). Decreased travel time makes it possible to carry less fuel, thus saving costs, and allows the air- lines to transport more passengers and cargo, increasing revenues. Because of the clear economic benefits, the use of polar routes has grown dramatically over the last decade. In 2007, thirteen carriers flew polar routes for a combined total of almost 7300 polar flights, an increase of nearly 2000 flights from the prior year. The transpolar routes take aircraft to latitudes where satellite communication cannot be used, and flight crews must rely instead on high-frequency (HF) radio to maintain communication NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EXTENDED SUMMARY WASHINGTON 82 N CHICAGO ABERI DEVID RAMEL NIKIN ORVIT BEIJING SHANGHAI HONG KONG Figure 2. Routes flown by transpolar flights between North America and Asia. Originally designated Polar 1, 2, 3, and 4, the routes were re-named after the waypoints ABERI, DEVID, RAMEL, and ORVIT. A fifth route, NIKIN 5.1 Stills.eps (shown in red), was added in 2007. At latitudes above 82Â° (yellow & typeflight crews cannot use satellite commu- bitmap w vector rules circle), nications and must rely instead on high-frequency (HF) radio to remain in contact with air traffic control. Changes in the polar ionosphere caused by solar energetic particle precipitation can degrade or totally black out HF radio communication. Transpolar flights must therefore be re-routed during intense solar radiation storms (solar energetic particle events). Timely space weather forecasts are important both for short-term (3-4 hour) operational planning and for longer-term (1 day) infrastructure planning (e.g., regarding air crew and aircraft assignments). (Image cour- tesy of Michael Stills, United Airlines.) with the airline company and air traffic control, as required by federal regulation. During certain severe space weather events (referred to by the SWPC as âsolar radiation stormsâ), solar energetic particlesâprimarily protons accelerated by CME-driven shocksâspiral down geomagnetic field lines into the polar ionosphere, where they increase the density of the ionized gas, which in turn affects the ability of the radio waves to propagate and can result in a complete radio blackout. Such polar cap absorption (PCA) events can last for several days, during which time aircraft must be diverted to latitudes where satellite communication links can be used. During several days of NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EXTENDED SUMMARY disturbed space weather in January 2005, for example, 26 United Airlines flights were diverted to nonpolar or less-than-optimum polar routes to avoid the risk of HF radio blackouts during PCA events. The increased flight time and extra landings and take-offs required by such route changes increased fuel consumption and raised cost, while the delays disrupted connections to other flights. Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing The 24 Global Positioning System satellites operated by the United States Air Force provide accurate positioning and timing information to a variety of military, government, and civilian users. In addition, âaugmentationsâ by both commercial services and government agencies improve the accuracy, integrity, and availability of GPS data. For example, as part of the transi- tion to space-based navigation as the primary means of navigation used by the National Airspace System, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which provides precision horizontal and vertical navigation service over the continental United States, Alaska, and most of Canada and Mexico. WAAS effectively increases the capacity of the aviation system by allowing for reduced horizontal and vertical separation standards between planes without additional risk and by providing highly accurate vertical posi- tioning that enables precision approaches and landings. Current GPS-based navigation and positioning systems are vulnerable to space weatherâ specifically, to ionospheric density irregularities that affect the propagation of the signals from the GPS satellites to the receivers on the ground. Such irregularities are a routine occurrence near the equator; during magnetic storms, however, they occur in the midlatitude ionosphere as well. Degradation of the GPS signal by ionospheric irregularities produces ranging errors and can result in the temporary loss of GPS reception. Solar radio bursts have recently been found to be an additional source of interference with GPS reception in Earthâs sunlit hemisphere. Systems that use single-frequency receivers without augmentation are vulnerable even to minor ionospheric disturbances. Augmented systems are less susceptible to disruption by minor and moderate ionospheric disturbances but still can be adversely affected by scintillation, solar radio bursts, and major ionospheric disturbances. Thus, when WAAS detects ionospheric distur- bances, it disables the use of precision navigation in the affected areas so that safety is never compromised. When large areas of disturbance are detected, precision navigation is disabled for all areas until 8 hours after disturbances cease. During the October 2003 magnetic storms, for example, WAAS vertical navigation service was disabled for approximately 30 hours, although horizontal navigation guidance was continuously available (Figures 3 and 4). To mitigate the effects of space weather on the GPS, new signals and codes are being imple- mented that will allow GPS receivers to remove ionospheric ranging errors. This capability is expected to make augmentation systems unnecessary. In addition, the new signals and codes will be more resistant to fades caused by scintillation or solar radio bursts. The implementation of the new codes and signals, including the L5 signal dedicated to aviation, will take place incre- mentally over the next decade.

In addition to its use in aviation, GPS positioning and timing information is widely used in a number of other applications, including precision farming, surveying and mapping, marine navigation, offshore drilling rig positioning, and transportation. Future Vulnerabilities: The Specter of Extreme Space Weather Past With increasing awareness and understanding of space weather and its effects on modern technological systems, vulnerable industries have adopted procedures and technologies designed to mitigate the impacts of space weather on their operations and customers. As noted above, airlines re-route flights scheduled for polar routes during intense solar energetic particle events in order to preserve reliable communications. Alerted to an impending geomagnetic storm and monitoring ground currents in real-time, power grid operators take defensive measures to protect the grid against GICs. Similarly, under adverse space weather conditions, launch personnel may NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 10 EXTENDED SUMMARY Figure 4.

(Image adapted from material supplied by Leo Eldredge, Federal Avia- tion Adminstration.) delay a launch, and satellite operators may postpone certain operations. For the spacecraft indus- try, however, the primary approach to mitigating space weather effects remains designing satellites to operate under extreme environmental conditions to the maximum extent possible within cost and resource constraints. GPS modernization through the addition of the new navigation signals and new codes will help mitigate space weather effects, although to what degree is not known. The FAA will therefore maintain âlegacyâ non-GPS-based navigation systems as a backup. Our understanding of the vulnerabilities of modern technologies to severe space weather and the protective measures that have been developed are based largely on lessons learned during the past 20 or 30 years, during such episodes of severe space weather as the geomagnetic storms of March 1989 and October-November 2003. As severe as these recent events have been, the historical record reveals that space weather of even greater severity has occurred in the past (e.g., the âCarrington Eventâ of 1859 and the great magnetic storm of May 1921) and suggests that such extreme events, although rare, are likely to occur again some time in the future (see âThe Great Magnetic Storms of August-September 1859,â pp. 14-15). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EXTENDED SUMMARY 11 It is not known how a severe space weather event far more intense than any experienced during the space age might impact our modern technological systems. Of particular concern is the degree to which the electric power grid, which lies at the heart of our national infrastructure, might be affected by such an event. A study by the Metatech Corporation suggests that, despite the protective procedures developed since the Hydro-QuÃ©bec collapse, an unusually powerful magnetic storm could result in widespread outages and possible long-term damage to the nationâs power grid. The Metatech study uses the great magnetic storm of May 1921 (âone of the great- est storms of the past ~130 yearsâ3) to estimate the impact of an extreme space weather event on todayâs electric power grid. Using the rate of change in Earthâs magnetic field measured in nanoteslas (nT) per minute as a proxy for GIC intensity, Metatech estimates that GICs during the 1921 storm would have been ten times more intense than those responsible for the March 1989 event. A storm of this magnitude today could result in large-scale blackouts affecting more than 130 million people (Figure 5). Moreover, according to the Metatech analysis, the intense GIC flows produced by the storm would place more than 300 large extra-high-voltage transformers at risk of failure or permanent damage, likely requiring a prolonged recovery period with long-term shortages of electric power to the affected areas (Figure 6). Collateral Impacts of Severe Space Weather An assessment of the societal and economic impacts of severe space weather must look beyond such direct space weather effects as spacecraft anomalies and power grid outages and consider how disruptions of vulnerable technological systems can affect the various sectors of society that are dependent on the functioning of these systems. Given the state of technology in the mid-19th century, the societal and economic impacts of the 1859 Carrington Event were limited to the disruptions of telegraph service âat the busy season when the telegraph is more than usually required,â4 the telegraph companiesâ associated loss of income, and whatever the attendant effects on commerce might have been. Should an event of the magnitude of the Car- rington Event occur today, the story could be quite different because of the central role that technologyâin particular, electric powerâplays in our society and because of the dependencies and interdependencies that characterize our critical infrastructures, rendering them vulnerable to failures cascading from one system to another. Some of the indirect or collateral effects of a severe space weather event are vividly described in the following account of the 1989 Hydro-QuÃ©bec blackout as it was experienced by the citi- zens of Montreal. The blackout closed schools and businesses, kept the Montreal Metro shut down during the morning rush hour, and paralyzed Dorval Airport, delaying flights. Without their navigation radar, no flight could land or take off until power had been restored. People ate their cold breakfast in the dark and left for work. They soon found themselves stuck in traffic that attempted to navigate darkened intersections without any streetlights or traffic control systems operating. . . . All these buildings [in downtown Montreal] were now pitch dark, stranding workers in offices, stairwells, and elevators. By some accounts, the blackout cost businesses tens of millions of dollars as it stalled production, idled workers, and spoiled products.5 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 12 EXTENDED SUMMARY Figure 5.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EXTENDED SUMMARY 13 A major power blackout, whether the result of severe space weather or severe terrestrial weather, has the potential to affect virtually all sectors of society: communications, transporta- tion, banking and finance, commerce, manufacturing, energy, government, education, health care, public safety, emergency services, the food and water supply, and sanitation (Figure 7). The severity of the impacts depends on a number of variables, including the duration of the outage. The socioeconomic impacts of a long-term outage, requiring replacement of permanently dam- aged transformers, could be extensive and serious. According to an estimate by the Metatech Corporation, the total cost of a long-term, wide-area blackout caused by an extreme space weather event could be as much as $1 trillion to $2 trillion during the first year, with full recovery requir- ing 4 to 10 years depending on the extent of the damage. (For comparison, the total cost for the United States of the August 2003 blackoutâa major non-space-weather-related blackout that affected 50 million people in the northeastern United States and Ontarioâis estimated to have been between $4 billion and $10 billion.6) Figure 7.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 14 EXTENDED SUMMARY The Great Magnetic Storms of August-September 1859 (the Carrington Event)7 Shortly after midnight on September 2, 1859, campers in the Rocky Mountains were awakened by an âauroral light, so bright that one could easily read common print.â The campersâ account, published in the Rocky Mountain News, continues, âSome of the party insisted that it was daylight and began the preparation of breakfast.â Eighteen hundred miles to the east, Henry C. Perkins, a respected physician in Newburyport, Massachusetts, observed âa perfect dome of alternate red and green streamersâ over New England. To the citizens of Havana, Cuba, the sky that night âappeared stained with blood and in a state of general confla- gration.â Dramatic auroral displays had been seen five nights before as well, on the night of August 28/29, when (again in the words of Dr. Perkins) âthe whole celestial vault was glowing with streamers, crimson, yellow, and white, gathered into waving brilliant folds.â In New York City, thousands gathered on sidewalks and rooftops to watch âthe heavens . . . arrayed in a drapery more gorgeous than they have been for years.â The aurora that New Yorkers witnessed that Sunday night, the New York Times assured its readers, âwill be referred to hereafter among the events which occur but once or twice in a lifetime.â8 Low-latitude red auroras, such as those widely reported to have been observed during the Carrington Event, are a characteristic feature of major geomagnetic storms. The aurora shown here was photographed over Napa Valley, Cali- fornia, during the magnetic storm of November 5, 2001. (Image courtesy D. Obudzinski, Â© Dirk Obudzinski 2001, www. borealis2000.com.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EXTENDED SUMMARY 15 From August 28 through September 4, auroral displays of extraordinary brilliance were observed throughout North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, and were seen as far south as Hawaii, the Caribbean, and Central America in the Northern Hemisphere and in the Southern Hemisphere as far north as Santiago, Chile. Even after daybreak, when the aurora was no longer visible, its presence contin- ued to be felt through the effect of the auroral currents. Magnetic observatories recorded disturbances in Earthâs field so extreme that magnetometer traces were driven off scale, and telegraph networks around the worldâthe âVictorian Internetâ9âexperienced major disruptions and outages. âThe electricity which attended this beautiful phenomenon took possession of the magnetic wires throughout the country,â the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin reported, âand there were numerous side displays in the telegraph offices where fantastical and unreadable messages came through the instruments, and where the atmospheric fireworks assumed shape and substance in brilliant sparks.â10 In several locations, operators disconnected their systems from the batteries and sent messages using only the current induced by the aurora.11 The auroras were the visible manifestation of two powerful magnetic storms that occurred near the peak of the sunspot cycle. The two storms, which occurred in rapid succession, are referred as the âCarrington Eventâ in honor of Richard Carrington, a British amateur astronomer. On September 1, the day before the onset of the second storm, Carrington had observed an outburst of âtwo patches of intensely bright and white lightâ12 from a large and complex group of sunspots near the center of the Sunâs disk. Although the connection was not understood at the time, Carringtonâs observation provided the first evidence that erup- tive activity on the Sun is the ultimate cause of geomagnetic storms. We know today that what Carrington observed was an extraordinarily intense white-light flare that was associated with a powerful, fast-moving coronal mass ejection (CME). The CME and the shock wave that preceded it impacted Earthâs magnetosphere some 17.5 hours after Carringtonâs observation, triggering an unusually severe geomagnetic storm. In addition to the low-latitude auroras and intense auroral currents responsible for the telegraph outages, all of the phenomena known today to be characteristic of a major magnetic storm occurred as well, although the mid-19th century lacked the means to detect and measure them, and its most sophisticated technologies were unaffected by them: an increased Earthward flow of magnetospheric plasma, creating or intensifying the ring current; the explosive release of stored magnetic energy in multiple magnetospheric substorms; an increase in the energy content of the radiation belts as well as the possible creation of temporary new belts; and changes in the ionospheric and thermospheric density at midlatitudes. Recent analysis of ice core data indicates that the geomagnetic storm was also ac- companied by a solar energetic particle event four times more intense than the most severe solar energetic particle event of the space age. By this as well as other measures, the Carrington Event ranks as one of the most severe space weather eventsâand by some measures the most severeâon record.13 Locations of reported auroral observations during the first ~1.5 hours of the September 2, 1859, magnetic 1.2 Green.eps storm (orange dots).

But managing the effects of severe space weather is not just a technical problem: it is also, importantly, a problem of institutions and of society. A key issue affecting our ability to prevent disruption of large technical systems is the difficulty of developing the appropriate institutions to deal with the problem on a long-term basis. Institutional devel- opment occurs most often under conditions of frequent accidents or errors. When nothing bad appears to happen from one year to another, sustaining preparedness and planning in out-years is extraordinarily challenging. Consequently, space weather is not on the radar screen of many people outside the small technical community and some affected businesses. Dependency creep, risk migration, and new technologies are potential problems for operators of large technical systems. As systems become more complex, and as they grow in size, understanding and over- sight become more difficult. Subsystems and dependencies may evolve that escape the close scrutiny of organization operators. Dependencies allow risk present in one part the other overall system to âmigrateâ to others, with potentially damaging results. GPS and electric power systems have clearly accelerated dependency creep, and consequent risk migration. New technologies, such as nanoscale components, may not be adequately understood in the context of 11-year solar cycles. One of the most fundamental concerns for operators of large technical systems is the efficiency-vul- nerability tradeoffâthat is, the question of how much reserve capacity is available to deal with uncertainty and contingencies. In stable protected environments, systems operate with excess capacity: costs are passed on to users and the society. In competitive-market but benign environments, however, systems operate at close to their efficiency frontiers. Slack resources are consumed, buffers shrink, costs fall, and profits rise. But in competitive-market and âhostileâ environments where unexpected developments perturb the system, finely tuned technical systems become brittle and have trouble operating outside relatively narrow parameters. Vulnerability can be the consequence of increased efficiency. âSecurity externalitiesâ emerge due to interdependencies, lack of knowledge, lack of slack, lack of trust, and lack of ways to overcome coordination problems. Space storms of the magnitude of the Carrington Event are fortunately very rare, and the risk that such an event might cause a long-term catastrophic power grid collapse with major socio- economic disruptions, while real, is low. In the field of risk analysis, such an extreme event is termed a low-frequency/high-consequence (LF/HC) event. In terms of their potential broader, col- lateral impacts, LF/HC events present a unique set of problems for public (and private) institutions and governance, different from the problems raised by conventional, expected, and frequently experienced events. As a consequence, dealing with the collateral impacts of LF/HC events requires different types of budgeting and management capabilities and consequently challenges the basis for conventional policies and risk management strategies, which assume a universe of constant or reliable conditions. Moreover, because systems can quickly become dependent on new technologies in ways that are unknown and unexpected by both developers and users, vulnerabilities in one part of the broader system have a tendency to spread to other parts of the system. Consequently, it is difficult to understand, much less to predict, the consequences of future LF/HC events. Sustaining preparedness and planning for such events in future years is equally difficult (Box 1).\nPassage 4:\nDon't call it Solar Probe Plus anymore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA's upcoming sun-studying mission, which will come much closer to Earth's star than any spacecraft in history, has been renamed the Parker Solar Probe, agency officials announced today (May 31). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new moniker honors pioneering University of Chicago astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of the solar wind — the stream of charged particles flowing constantly from the sun — back in 1958. [Solar Quiz: How Well Do You Know Our Sun?] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA has named about 20 space missions after people; the Hubble Space Telescope is perhaps the most famous example. But the 89-year-old Parker is the first researcher to be celebrated in this manner while still alive, agency officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm certainly greatly honored to be associated with such a heroic scientific space mission,\" Parker said during a press conference at the University of Chicago today.

Credit: Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ambitious $1.5 billion Parker Solar Probe mission is scheduled to soar to solar orbit atop a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 31, 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the course of the next seven years, the spacecraft will perform 24 close flybys of the sun, some of which will bring it within just 3.9 million miles (6.2 million kilometers) of the solar surface. That's well inside the orbit of Mercury, and seven times closer than any other probe has ever gotten to the sun, NASA officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The environment in this region is extreme, to say the least: During its closest encounters, the 10-foot-long (3 meters) Parker Solar Probe is expected to experience temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,370 degrees Celsius) and solar radiation intensities 475 times greater than we're used to on Earth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mission controllers will therefore retract the Parker Solar Probe's solar arrays as it approaches the sun and extend them as the spacecraft retreats, to keep panel power levels and temperatures from fluctuating too much. And the probe will be outfitted with a 7.5-foot-wide (2.3 m), 4.5-inch-thick (11.4 centimeters) heat shield made of advanced carbon-composite material, which will allow its four science instruments to operate at about room temperature, NASA officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Parker Solar Probe will perform a number of tasks with this science gear, such as measure the sun's electric and magnetic fields, photograph solar structure and study the solar wind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If all goes according to plan, the Parker Solar Probe's observations will help mission scientists solve two long-standing puzzles: How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona, so much hotter than the solar surface (3 million degrees F, or 1.7 million degrees C, compared with 10,000 degrees F, or 5,500 degrees C)? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This latter situation is akin to water flowing uphill, said Parker Solar Probe mission scientist Nicola Fox, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland: \"It shouldn't happen.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These two big questions can be answered only by getting up-close observations of the sun, Fox added. And the answers are not just of academic interest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"One recent study by the National Academy of Sciences estimated that, without advance warning, a huge solar event could cause $2 trillion in damage in the U.S. alone, and the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. could be without power for a year,\" researchers at APL, which manages the mission for NASA, wrote in an online description. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In order to unlock the mysteries of the corona, but also to protect a society that is increasingly dependent on technology from the threats of space weather, we will send [the Parker Solar Probe] to touch the sun,\" they added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Parker Solar Probe will carry a chip loaded with photographs of Eugene Parker and a copy of his seminal 1958 solar-wind paper, Fox said. NASA has also invited Parker to come up with an inscription for a plate that will be installed on the spacecraft, she added.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Set to launch next year, the Parker Solar Probe promises to “revolutionise” mankind’s understanding of the Sun and the origins of physics, scientists said last night, as well as helping protect equipment from solar radiation.\nPassage 6:\n(CNN) Wearing a nearly 5-inch coat of carbon-composite solar shields, NASA's Parker Solar Probe will explore the sun's atmosphere in a mission that begins in the summer of 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's not a journey that any human can make, so NASA is sending a roughly 10-foot-high probe on the historic mission that will put it closer to the sun than any spacecraft has ever reached before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The probe will have to withstand heat and radiation never before experienced by any spacecraft, but the specially designed mission will also address questions that couldn't be answered before. Understanding the sun in greater detail can also shed light on Earth and its place in the solar system, researchers said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is NASA's first mission to the sun and its outermost atmosphere, called the corona. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, the craft -- initially called the Solar Probe Plus -- was renamed the Parker Solar Probe in honor of astrophysicist Eugene Parker. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is the first time NASA has named a spacecraft for a living individual,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the agency's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"It's a testament to the importance of his body of work, founding a new field of science that also inspired my own research and many important science questions NASA continues to study and further understand every day. I'm very excited to be personally involved honoring a great man and his unprecedented legacy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parker published research predicting the existence of solar wind in 1958, when he was a young professor at the University of Chicago's Enrico Fermi institute. At the time, astronomers believed that the space between planets was a vacuum. Parker's first paper was rejected, but it was saved by a colleague, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, an astrophysicist who would be awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Less than two years after Parker's paper was published, his theory of solar wind was confirmed by satellite observations. His work revolutionized our understanding of the sun and interplanetary space. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parker is now the S. Chandrasekhar Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago. Zurbuchen and Nicola Fox, the mission project scientist for Parker Solar Probe, also presented Parker with the first scale model of the probe and NASA's distinguished public service medal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm greatly honored to be associated with such a heroic scientific space mission,\" Parker said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Parker Solar Probe will carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate carrying whatever inscription Parker wishes to provide -- his message to the sun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The probe will eventually orbit within 3.7 million miles of the sun's surface. The observations and data could provide insight about the physics of stars, change what we know about the mysterious corona, increase understanding of solar wind and help improve forecasting of major space weather events. Those events can impact satellites and astronauts as well as the Earth -- including the power grid and radiation exposure on airline flights, NASA said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mission's objectives include \"tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind and explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've been inside the orbit of Mercury and done amazing things, but until you go and touch the sun, you can't answer these questions,\" Fox said. \"Why has it taken us 60 years? The materials didn't exist to allow us to do it. We had to make a heat shield, and we love it. Something that can withstand the extreme hot and cold temperature shifts of its 24 orbits is revolutionary.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Solar wind is the flow of charged gases from the sun that is present in most of the solar system. That wind screams past Earth at a million miles per hour, and disturbances of the solar wind cause disruptive space weather that impacts our planet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Space weather may not sound like something that concerns Earth, but surveys by the National Academy of Sciences have estimated that a solar event without warning could cause $2 trillion in damage in the United States and leave parts of the country without power for a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In order to reach an orbit around the sun, the Parker Solar Probe will take seven flybys of Venus that will essentially give the probe a gravity assist, shrinking its orbit around the sun over the course of nearly seven years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The probe will eventually be closer to the sun than Mercury. It will be close enough to watch solar wind whip up from subsonic to supersonic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When closest to the sun, the probe's 4½-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shields will have to withstand temperatures close to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to its design, the inside of the spacecraft and its instruments will remain at a comfortable room temperature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The probe will reach a speed of 450,000 mph around the sun. On Earth, this speed would enable someone to get from Philadelphia to Washington in one second, the agency said. The mission will also pass through the origin of the solar particles with the highest energy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The mission is scheduled to end in June 2025. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The solar probe is going to a region of space that has never been explored before,\" Parker said. \"It's very exciting that we'll finally get a look.

There always are.\"\nPassage 7:\nA future solar exploring spacecraft will change the understanding of the sun by aiming straight for our solar system's star. NASA revealed new details Wednesday about the first mission to visit the sun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During a news conference at the University of Chicago, NASA officials announced that the spacecraft would be called the Parker Solar Probe in honor of astrophysicist Eugene Parker, credited with discovering solar wind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On track for a summer 2018 launch, the spacecraft will rely on incredible feats of engineering that will allow the probe to touch the sun. A 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield will protect the probe from temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit while keeping the science instruments at room temperature.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The arrays, or panels, will retract and extend as the spacecraft moves around the sun, keeping it at a safe temperature and also powering it with the sun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parker Solar Probe's science objects include tracing the energy behind solar wind, understand the heating of the solar corona and to determine what accelerates the solar wind, according to the mission website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star, including finding out why the sun’s corona is so much hotter than its surface,” said mission scientist Nicola Fox, with Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After launch, Parker Solar Probe will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion or the closest point to the sun. The spacecraft will then repeat that flyby of the perihelion routine 23 more times over its lifetime until 2025. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the final orbits Parker Solar Probe will fly within 9 solar radii, or nine times the radius of the sun, of the sun’s “surface,” seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 20-day launch window opens July 31, 2018. After testing the assembly, the spacecraft will arrive at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center to prep for launch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's the first time a spacecraft will be named for a living person. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a testament to the importance of his body of work, founding a new field of science that also inspired my own research and many important science questions NASA continues to study and further understand every day,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "length": 10147, "dataset": "multi_news", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9be57ba61a999b76bd50af15e31946bb634beb32d7e8d31e"}
{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nPhoto Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The computer network at Neiman Marcus was penetrated by hackers as far back as July, and the breach was not fully contained until Sunday, according to people briefed on the investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, saying it first learned in mid-December of suspicious activity that involved credit cards used at its stores. It issued another notice on Thursday, elaborating slightly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The latest notice said that “some of our customers’ payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at our stores. We have taken steps to notify those affected customers for whom we have contact information.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company apologized again, and said it did not believe the customers’ Social Security numbers or birth dates — key pieces of personal data — had been compromised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neiman Marcus defended its decision not to disclose anything until last week, saying it waited to confirm evidence. The company said nothing about when the attack began and when it was contained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a call with credit card companies on Monday, though, Neiman acknowledged that the attack had only been fully contained a day earlier, and that the time stamp on the first intrusion was in mid-July, people briefed on the call said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The issue at Neiman appears to have gone on for significantly longer than the widespread attack on Target. In Target’s case, however, the data that was stolen appears to be much more significant and ripe for fraud. Target has said card numbers from 40 million customers were stolen, along with encrypted PINs for debit cards. It also estimated that other personal information belonging to 70 million people had been stolen by the hackers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neiman Marcus said on Thursday that it had “no knowledge of any connection” between its data breach and Target’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neiman has not publicly given any estimate of how many credit card numbers were stolen, or how many customers were affected. But it noted that it does not collect PINs in its stores. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company only publicly acknowledged the data breach last Friday after facing inquiries from a journalist specializing in computer security, Brian Krebs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Neiman had told credit card companies around Christmas, in an industry phone call, that it had evidence that credit cards used at Neiman Marcus were being used to make fraudulent purchases, people who were briefed on those phone calls said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neiman has faced criticism for not telling customers about the breach sooner. Target informed its customers about its attack within a few days of learning about it for the first time, pushed also by inquiries from Mr. Krebs. Target’s acknowledgment came right before the final holiday shopping weekend, and put a significant dent in Target’s sales in the final seasonal rush. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some people briefed on the investigation questioned Neiman’s decision not to disclose anything to the public until the shopping season was over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One person briefed by law enforcement on the investigation noted: “January 1 is conveniently timed after the holiday season.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus, Ginger Reeder, asserted on Thursday that the holiday season had nothing to do with its decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In its notice on Thursday, the company said: “We quickly began our investigation and hired a forensic investigator. Our forensic investigator discovered evidence on Jan. 1st that a criminal cybersecurity intrusion had occurred. The forensic and criminal investigations continue.” Neiman said it would provide customers with one free year of credit monitoring, similar to what Target has offered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A growing group of state attorneys general, including those from Connecticut, New York and Illinois, are jointly investigating both the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The authorities are examining whether the two attacks are related. Both appear to have been committed by criminal groups in Eastern Europe, people briefed on the investigation said.\nPassage 2:\nA 17-page report from a computer firm hired to look into the massive data breach at Target stores provides new insight into the holiday hacking that endangered data for more than 100 million customers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report, from computer firm iSight, was filed to the U.S. Secret Service and obtained by NBC News. It details the type of software used in the massive hack, how it was effective and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report however does not draw conclusions on who is ultimately responsible for the attack that scooped up credit and debit card data for tens of millions of customers, citing an active U.S. government investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The data breach was caused by a type of malware, similar to a computer virus, placed in a store's point-of-sale systems, it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While some components of the breach operation were technically sophisticated, the operational sophistication of the compromise activity makes this case stand out,\" according to the iSight report. \"The intrusion operators displayed innovation and a high degree of skill in orchestrating the various components of the activity.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report details specific regions where software capabilities exist to create the malware. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Memory scraping capabilities has been available in the Russian-language underground for some time,\" the report reads. \"While Eastern Europe has been the focal point for POS malware development and use, cyber criminals in Brazil have used the technique since at least 2009. Globally, this trend will probably continue because malware offers important cost and risk advantages over hardware skimming techniques.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here's how the malware works, according to the report: The insidious file triggers a \"hook\" and starts to suck up information on transactions in the memory of the cash register system or the server that controls it. Since the data on credit cards is encrypted, the system works by getting it in the authorization stage while it is in the memory of the POS system, unencrypted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tactic used during the Target holiday hackers is \"new to eCrime,\" the report says, and \"covertly subverts network controls and common forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report concludes that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cyber crooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nA ranger from the Kenya Wildlife Service shoots dead a male lion that had strayed from the Nairobi National Park, in Kajiado, Kenya Wednesday, March 30, 2016. A lion was shot dead in Kenya on Wednesday... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A lion was shot dead in Kenya on Wednesday after attacking a man, while trackers in South Africa searched for a lion whose escape from a park prompted appeals to wildlife officials to relocate it rather than kill it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two cases of African lions on the loose highlight the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century because of unregulated hunting, a loss of habitat and growing conflict with livestock herders. Concern about the threatened species intensified last year when an American dentist killed a lion named Cecil in a hunt in Zimbabwe that officials said was illegal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The circumstances of the stray lions also fueled questions about whether to dart a potentially dangerous predator with a tranquilizer and return it to a fenced area, or kill it before it can attack people. Such decisions depend on factors including the training of wildlife experts, their resources and whether the area where a lion is roaming is densely populated. In some cases, local residents have killed lions before officials arrived on the scene. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wildlife officials in Kenya shot the escaped lion several times after it injured a man in the Kajiado district, near Nairobi, the capital, said Paul Udoto, a spokesman for the Kenya Wildlife Service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials had planned to capture the lion, but the animal become too agitated by the noise of a gathering crowd and had to be killed, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another senior Kenyan wildlife official, Kitili Mbathi, blamed a faulty electrical fence for the lion's escape from Nairobi National Park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, a later statement from the Kenya Wildlife Service said the lion was killed in a wildlife migration area outside the park's southern section, which is not fenced, and that the lion was trying to establish new territory. The 13-year-old male lion named Mohawk had recently been involved in territorial fights, according to the statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lion struck a 27-year-old man on a motorcycle who was among 400 people surrounding the lion, the wildlife service said. The man suffered deep lacerations on his back as well as bruises from falling off the bike, it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was the second incident this month involving a stray lion in Kenya. On March 18, a lion mauled a pedestrian in Nairobi before being captured. Nairobi National Park, which covers 117 square kilometers (45 square miles) on the outskirts of the city, is home to endangered black rhinos, lions, leopards, cheetahs, giraffes and diverse birdlife. The park is under growing pressure as the city expands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In South Africa, wildlife officials backtracked from earlier statements that they would kill a lion that escaped from Karoo National Park because it was a threat to humans. Those statements were met with an outcry from people who say the lion, dubbed Sylvester in local media, should be captured and relocated. It is the lion's second escape from the park, located in an arid and sparsely populated part of South Africa. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year, wildlife staff also labeled the Karoo lion \"Spook\" — \"Ghost\" in the Afrikaans language — because of its ability to stay one step ahead of searchers during its first breakout. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The South African parks service said they are now considering various options, including returning the lion to the park and improving its fencing, moving the lion to another park, donating the lion to a conservation group or killing it if it causes \"massive\" damage — an apparent reference to livestock it may kill — or is a direct threat to humans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Specifically, the loss of human life poses an even greater danger as the animal may lose fear for humans and see them as easy prey,\" the parks service said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It said the search for the lion is hampered by difficult terrain and windy conditions that prevented an aerial search. Trackers on foot are also concerned about \"a possible ambush\" by the lion, the statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 3-year-old male lion escaped several days ago. It is wearing a satellite tracking collar that was installed after last year's escape, during which it eluded capture for more than three weeks and killed 28 sheep, one cow and one kudu antelope.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most famous lion in Kenya died a horrific, agonising — and many people say senseless — death. He was killed on Wednesday morning by rangers after he strayed from Nairobi National Park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohawk had been tormented for hours before KWS rangers arrived and killed him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Social media is in an uproar over what is being called the brutal and needless killing of the 13-year-old star attraction, beloved by tourists. Video shows the lion roaring and writhing in pain as he is felled by at nine bullets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The killing has been described as heinous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was no attempt to tranquillise the black-maned lion, known as the \"ladies lion\" because he was often with females. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was named Mohawk for his distinctive Mohawk-style mane that rose in a tuft from his forehead. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohawk had been cornered, surrounded, taunted and stoned for about six hours before he lunged at a passing boda boda rider in Isinya, Kajiado county. The man was knocked down and clawed as the lion tried to flee his tormentors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local officials had tried to protect Mohawk until KWS arrived, but a crowd arrived and morans attacked him with arrows and spears. He broke through the crowd and attacked the boda boda in his way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When KWS rangers arrived, they said they had no choice but to kill him. Tranquilliser darts would take minutes to take effect and in that time the enraged lion might injure others, they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohawk was just 30km from the park, where he was born. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have been here all these hours protecting this lion. The rangers came with guns but we suggested the lion be sedated and taken back to the park. They have spoiled everything by killing the cat. This is wrong,” Isinya deputy county commissioner David Kipkemei told the Star. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About Mohawk NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohawk was one of 35 lions in Nairobi National Park, one of 2,000 nationwide. He was born in the park in 2003. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He belonged to the King Fisher pride of lions that roamed the Park Forest, King Fisher picnic site, Lion Corner, Maasai Gate and Hyena Dam within the park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was the only male seen repeatedly in the company of lionesses. He had a five-year-old companion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR KWS spokesman Paul Udoto said Mohawk was beloved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is unfortunate the southern part of the park is not fenced. It serves as a seasonal park where animals migrate indifferent seasons. We suspect Mohawk could have moved out through the area,\" Udoto told the Star on the phone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also read: Lion guarded six hours, only for KWS rangers to shoot it dead NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Resident Jason Parantai had called the Star at 6am, saying the lion had been spotted and residents informed local police. He said the animal was tormented and stressed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died. You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it, We blame them for this heinous act,” Parantai said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Environment CS Judi Wakhungu blamed the infrastructure projects at the wedge of Nairobi National Park for the increasing number of stray lions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shee said major construction, especially on the Western and Southern part of the park, generate a lot of noise that disturbs the lions that causes them to leave the park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a result of construction, all the electric fencing — intended to keep animals inside — has been destroyed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are working with contractors to ensure they maintain the integrity of the park and keep all animals safe,\" Wakhungu said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said though her priority is to safeguard wildlife, talks are underway with the Kenya Railways Corporation and the Transport ministry on how to balance how to balance sustainable management of natural resources and infrastructure development.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The animal management team that first arrived had no tranquilizers, only rifles. A second, with tranquilizers, was on its way, but the first team killed the animal before arriving because he posed an immediate threat to human life, a spokesman for Kenya Wildlife Services said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We lost one of our best lions,” said Nelly Palmeris, a senior park warden at Nairobi National Park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It turns out that a group of men had surrounded the lion in the town of Isinya, 20 miles from Nairobi, the capital. They took pictures. They threw rocks at him. Finally, Mohawk raised his paw and thrashed one of the men. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohawk the Lion, one of Kenya's most famous big cats, was shot and killed Wednesday, March 30 by wildlife rangers. (Reuters) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “When it injured that person, it became imminent to us that it could lead to a worse situation and it had to be brought down,” said Kenya Wildlife Service spokesman Paul Gathitu. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In pictures of the shooting, the lion appears to be walking on an unpopulated stretch of farmland when a ranger takes aim, striking the animal's right leg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I am outraged, disgusted and grossly disappointed with Kenya Wildlife Services,” Aisha Tande, a Nairobi resident, tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Nairobi, Mohawk — with a shock of hair rising from his head — was well known to tourists, a lion that had become accustomed to the sight of safari trucks and camera-toting visitors. He was featured in a local newspaper’s travel article last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mohawk did not appear to be concerned about all the cars behind him and he continued to walk at a leisurely pace as he enjoyed the freshness of the morning,” Gareth Jones wrote in the Star newspaper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was the third time in two months that lions had escaped from Nairobi National Park. One found its way to a military barracks, another to a strip of land near the international airport. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The population around the park has grown more than tenfold since it was established in 1946. Where the lions once would have wandered peacefully, they now encounter suburbs, farms and commercial buildings. If Mohawk hadn’t been surrounded, he wouldn’t have been shot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He had escaped from Nairobi National Park two days ago, forced out in a territorial dispute with another lion. So he walked south, looking for another place to roam, slipping through an unfenced portion of the park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In another corner of Africa on Wednesday, another lion was being hunted after escaping from a park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In South Africa, a lion named Sylvester had escaped from Karoo National Park. Like in Kenya, wildlife officials said he posed a threat. On Wednesday, they prepared to kill him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The decision taken earlier today to put him down was not taken lightly,” South African National Parks tweeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He is clearly a troublesome lion and could be a danger to humans,” Reynold Thakhuli, a spokesman for South African National Parks, told the Agence France-Presse.

Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—Kenya Wildlife Service officials tell the AP about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Archaeologists at a medieval fortress site in Burgas, Bulgaria, found a lead vessel, which contains some of the ashes from the alleged grave of John the Apostle, in a reliquary that dates to the sixth century C.E. The reliquary, which was once part of an early Christian basilica, is named for Saint John the Theologian, who is considered one of Jesus' apostles. The vessel, which is less than an inch long, is decorated with crosses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Milen Nikolov, director of the Burgas Regional Museum of History, said that early Christians would have believed the relic had healing properties. John the Apostle's grave in Turkey was also a pilgrimage site for early Christians seeking healing, Ancient Origins reports. Nikolov said the reliquary was \"one of the most important discoveries\" in the museum's history. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the relic, the archaeologists also uncovered a 10th century Bulgarian royal seal at the fortress site. Meghan DeMaria\nPassage 2:\nAshes from the grave of John the Apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ, have been discovered in a lead tube reliquary by Bulgarian archaeologists during excavations of the ancient and medieval port of Burgos (also known as Poros) on Cape Foros in today’s Black Sea city of Burgas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery of the lead tube containing ashes from the grave of John the Apostle, who is known as St. John the Theologian in Bulgarian (Eastern) Orthodox Christianity, located in the ancient city of Ephesus in Anatolia, today’s Turkey, has been made during the 2014 excavations of the fortress of Burgos (or Poros) on Cape Foros in Burgas but was announced only on Wednesday, March 25, 2015, by Milen Nikolov, Director of the Burgas Regional Museum of History, at a special press conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He has also announced other intriguing finds such as the discovery of a Late Antiquity latrine, also found at Burgos (Poros), and the discovery of a 10th century Bulgarian royal seal from the Rusocastro Fortress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The structures at the ancient and medieval fortress and port of Burgos (Poros) which were excavated in 2014 include an Early Christian basilica from the 6th century AD, a building complex from the 5th-6th century AD, and a Roman villa from the 3rd century AD. The John the Apostle reliquary was found in the 6th century basilica. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Probably a pilgrim from the Foros Peninsula (Cape) went on a pilgrimage to Ephesus, and came back here with this relic which was then donated to the basilica on Foros,” Nikolov has explained, as cited by local news site Gramofona. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nikolov has described the finding of the reliquary as “one of the most important discoveries in the history of the [Burgas Regional History] Museum”, and the lead tube as a “holy possession that preserved a holy substance” having to do with the beliefs that every year on May 8, the date of John the Apostle’s death, there is manna, a holy curing powder, on the site of his grave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lead tube reliquary itself containing the ashes from the grave of John the Apostle (St. John the Theologian) is really tiny: it is only 2.2 cm (less than an inch) long, and its diameter measures 1.7 cm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reliquary is dated to the 6th century AD when pilgrimage to the Holy Lands was very common among Christians, Nikolov explains. On one of its sides there is an image of a cross with equal arms inside a medallion, and on the opposite side there is an image of two overlapping crosses with equal arms. The neck of the tube is also decorated with crosses. It has only one handle left, the other has broken off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the so called Empty Tomb, i.e. the Tomb of Jesus Christ in Jerusalem, the other centers of Christian pilgrimage in the 6th century AD included the grave of St. Menas in Abu Mina in Egypt; the grave of St. Simeon Stylites the Elder in Antioch (in today’s Turkey); the grave of St. Thecla (or Tecla) in Seleucia, Mesopotamia; the grave of St. Isidore of Chios on the Aegean island of Chios; and the graves of John the Apostle (St. John the Theologian), St. Mary Magdalene, and St. Timothy in Ephesus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of these Early Christian pilgrimage centers produced primarily clay tubes for holy water; a total of only 43 lead tubes from this time period are known in the entire world, the Bulgarian archaeologists from the Burgas Museum point out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They explaining 20 of those known lead tubes have been found in the St. John the Baptist Basilica in Monza, Italy (the Monza Cathedral); they were a gift from Lombard Queen Theodelinda (c. 570-628) made at the beginning of the 6th century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another 16 lead tubes have been found in a grave in the Bobbio Abbey (a monastery founded by Irish Saint Columbanus in 614 AD) in the Italian town of Bobbio, close to Milan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One lead tube reliquary has been discovered in the Sant Pere de Casserres Abbey, a Benedictine monastery in the town of Les Masies de Roda, Osona comarca, Catalonia, Spain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to these lead tube reliquaries, three others are kept in Germany and four in the USA, all of which were produced in Jerusalem and have depictions of Gospel scenes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even though the reliquary discovered by the Bulgarian archaeologists in the basilica in the ancient and medieval fortress Burgos (Poros) on Cape Foros is also a lead tube, it is different from the other known lead tube reliquaries because the images on it are identical with the images from a group of clay tube reliquaries produced in ancient Ephesus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That is why at this stage we believe that the Burgas reliquary comes from this pilgrimage center (i.e. Ephesus) and it must be connected with the cult for St. John the Theologian (John the Apostle),” the head of the Burgas Museum of History, Milen Nikolov, explains. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also notes that John the Apostle was particularly cherished by the Early Christians. According to the Bible, John was Jesus Christ’s favorite disciple, and when Jesus was crucified he asked John to take care of the Holy Mother, Virgin Mary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later, John the Apostle settled in the ancient city of Ephesus together with Virgin Mary and St. Mary Magdalene. This is where he wrote the Book of Revelation, also known as The Apocalypse, and lived till the rest of his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to some historical sources, Christian pilgrims from around the world would gather on his grave in the Ephesus basilica on May 8, the date of his death. They would sprinkle rose petals on the rock above the basilica, and the next day wonder-working powder would appear on the rock. This manna could cure all kinds of diseases, which is why it was collected by the pilgrims in reliquaries and taken to their places of origin as evidence of their pilgrimage or as an apotropeus (an apotropaic item, i.e. an amulet chasing away evil). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some scholars believe the manna collected by the pilgrims came from the pollen from the roses they placed on John the Apostle’s grave in Ephesus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That is why, at this point, we believe that a pilgrim from the fortress of Poros went on a pilgrimage to the grave of St. John the Theologian in Ephesus from where he brought the valuable reliquary with curing powder,” Nikolov elaborates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discovery of the lead tube reliquary with ashes from the grave of John the Apostle in Ephesus near Burgas resembles another relic discovery from the same region, Bulgaria’s Southern Black Sea coast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Back in 2010 during excavations of an ancient monastery on the St. Ivan (St. John) Island in the Black Sea, off the coast of Bulgaria’s Sozopol, just to the north of Burgas (and the ancient and medieval port of Burgos (Poros) on Cape Foros), Bulgarian archaeologist Prof. Kazimir Popkonstantinov discovered a reliquary containing relics of St. John the Baptist. The relics of St. John the Baptist, which consist of small bone particles from a skull, jaw bone, arm bone, and tooth, have received lots of international interest in the years since then, and in February 2015 CNN reported that Oxford University scholars had confirmed the possibility of their authenticity by concluding that they belonged to a man who lived in the Middle East at the same time as Jesus Christ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Background Infonotes: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ancient and medieval fortress and port of Burgos (Poros) is located on the Cape of Foros in the Bulgarian Black Sea city of Burgas. It was first first excavated in 2008 by archaeologists Milen Nikolov (currently Director of the Burgas Regional Museum of History), Dr. Tsonya Drazheva, and Konstantin Gospodinov, after access to its site was denied for decades because of the existence of a nearby military base which has been closed down in recent years. Part of its fortress wall was first discovered in 1989 during the construction of a cow farm. Even though there have been traces of ancient life, the fortress and port city of Burgos (Poros) on the Cape of Foros in Bulgaria’s Burgas is dated back to the Late Antiquity / Late Roman period, with the Bulgarian archaeologists uncovering a large number of buildings, artifacts, and pottery vessels dating back to the 4th-6th century AD. Their excavations have revealed a complex set of fortifications, including walls, ramparts, and towers, which were rebuilt and reorganized multiple times from the 4th until the middle of the 15th century, and were in use throughout this entire period by different states: the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire. Some of the more interesting finds including a stone block with an Ancient Roman inscription in Greek mentioning the name of Roman Emperor Gordian III (r. 238-244 AD); a 2nd century AD inscription carved into stone stating that “burgi” (fortifications) were built on the border of the Roman colony of Deultum (located some 10 km inland from the Black Sea coast near today’s town of Debelt) – hence, possibly, the name Burgos; a basilica; the remains of a small monastery called “St. George” which is described in a 13th century Byzantine source; the 6th century lead tube reliquary containing ashes from the grave of John the Apostle in Ephesus, Anatolia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Foros pennisula was marked on Italian and Catalan maps from the 13th-17th century as an old fortress and port under the name Poro (strait) or Poros, which means that the fortress defended the waterway entry point of the nearby Lake Mandra which flows out into the Black Sea. A stone inscription dating back to the 2nd century AD (presently exhibited in the Burgas Regional Museum of History) discovered on the site states that “burgi” (fortifications) were built on the border of Roman colony Deultum (located some 10 km inland from the Black Sea coast near today’s town of Debelt). Historians believe that there used to be a large fortified port along the waterway between Lake Mandra and the Black Sea which served and protected the Roman city of Deultum. The Roman road station called Pudizo marked in the 4th century Tabula Peutingeriana (the Peutinger Map showing cursus publicus, the road network in the Roman Empire, covering Europe, North Africa and parts of Asia) has been discovered in this same area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The area of the Burgos (Poros) fortress and the Cape of Foros is also famous for being the site of a major battle during the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185-1396 AD). The so called Battle of Skafida (named after the Skafida River and the Skafida Fortress, another medieval fortress located nearby) took place in 1304 AD when the forces of Bulgarian Tsar Theodore Svetoslav (r. 1300-1322 AD) defeated the army of Byzantine Emperor Michael IX Palaiologos (Palaeologus) (r. 1294-1320), after having reconquered earlier the nearby Black Sea cities of Rusocastro, Mesembria, Anchialos, Sozopolis and Agathopolis. The victory in the Battle of Skafida helped the Second Bulgarian Empire regain most of the region of Thrace from Byzantium bringing it a period of relative stability at the beginning of the 14th century, after feudal strife had put it in a state of permanent dynastic crisis at the end of the 13th century.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Senate Commerce Committee issued a report on the multibillion dollar data industry today, and the accompanying testimony and findings are chilling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the last year, the Committee queried nine of the major data companies and invited testimony from privacy groups. What's emerged is that collectively, these companies own an astounding number of consumer profiles, and they're selling deeply personal information — sometimes to identity thieves — in categories like rape victims, people with cancer, and “Rural and Barely Making It.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One data broker is selling lists of addresses and names of consumers suffering from conditions including cancer, diabetes, and depression, and the medications used for those conditions; another is offering lists naming consumers, their credit scores, and specific health conditions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of the nine companies the Committee approached — Acxiom, Experian, Epsilon, Reed Elsevier, Equifax, TransUnion, Rapleaf, Spokeo, and Datalogix — \"some\" were forthcoming. The report mentions Equifax as being particularly cooperative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others weren't. Acxiom, which according to the report has “multi-sourced insight into approximately 700 million consumers worldwide,” Experian, and Epsilon refused to explain how they collected their data or who they were selling it to, citing confidentiality clauses in their contracts. (The Attorney General of New Jersey recently released documents indicating Acxiom sold another company, Dataium, 400,000 dossiers for a mere $2,500.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In October, Experian admitted that it sold personal information — including social security numbers and banking information — through a subsidiary to an alleged online identity theft ring. That same subsidiary, Court Ventures, also appeared on a list of companies that requested private information about gun permit holders in Virginia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Equifax told the Committee they had information as specific as: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether a consumer purchased a particular soft drink or shampoo product in the last six months NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether they use laxatives or yeast infection products NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How many OB/GYN doctor visits they've had within the last 12 months NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How many miles they traveled in the last 4 weeks NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The number of whiskey drinks they consumed in the past 30 days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That data is then sorted into a dictionary with more than 75,000 data points like, \"whether the individual or household is a pet owner, smokes, has a propensity to purchase prescriptions through the mail, donates to charitable causes, is active military or a veteran, holds certain insurance products including burial insurance or juvenile life insurance, enjoys reading romance novels, or is a hunter.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Privacy groups testified that the companies also sell lists of rape victims and people with HIV and AIDs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This fine-tuned data collection isn't new — last year, the Times reported a story of how Target figured out a teenager was pregnant before her father did. Even in 2007, the Times reported on a company selling lists like, “Oldies but Goodies,” 500,000 gamblers over 55 years old, for 8.5 cents each, and one list that said: “These people are gullible. They want to believe that their luck can change.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But their databases are growing infinitely, and there are still no relevant consumer protection laws in place to protect individual privacy. And despite recent transparency efforts — like Acxiom's aboutthedata.com — that also means the consumers on these lists still have no right to find out what information is out there, or who is buying it.

Marketers buy this data so they can target shoppers based on everything from their income to clothing size. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other lists the nonprofit found included the home addresses of police officers, a mailing list for domestic violence shelters (which are typically kept secret by law) and a list of people with addictive behaviors towards drug and alcohol.

And while medical privacy laws prohibit doctors from sharing patient information, medical information that data brokers get elsewhere, such as from the purchase of over-the-counter drugs and other health care items, is fair game. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In some cases, such lists could put people in harm's way. The list of more than 30,000 police officers' home addresses, for example, could put the lives of the officers and their families in danger, said Dixon.

Fallon for The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike Brown is an astronomer at Caltech who's been instrumental in the discovery of more than 30 dwarf planets and asteroids at the far reaches of our solar system. Most members of the general public probably don't know about all of the planetoids he has found — but many know about the one planet he has killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Brown and his team discovered Eris, a dwarf planet more massive than Pluto, it was initially referred to as our solar system's 10th planet. But that ended in 2006 when the International Astronomical Union voted to define \"planet\" officially for the first time. Eris was out of the running, and Pluto was a casualty — cut from the official planetary roll call. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, believe they've compiled the best evidence for a true ninth planet to take Pluto's place in the history books. We called Brown up to chat about the latest blow he has dealt to Pluto fans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This interview has been edited for length and clarity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington Post: How did you get into the planet finding (and planet killing) business? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike Brown: So, planetary science is something I got into when I was in grad school. I went into astronomy anticipating studying some of the most distant galaxies, but I fell in love with this field because planetary science is just so much more concrete to me. I could actually go outside at night and see this thing I was studying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I can’t do that anymore! But it’s still much more visceral to me than some of the more abstract parts of astronomy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the reason why I particularly like these objects I study in the outer solar system is that they have grand importance for how our solar system came together, and how our planetary system formed, but it's also just as much about this journey of discovery. It’s exploration. For me, this is what we do as humans. We see our neighborhood out there and explore it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike Brown points to the gold ring showing the orbital path of Planet Nine. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon for The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: Tell us more about that \"grand importance.\" What can objects like Eris, Pluto and Planet Nine teach us about the origins of the solar system? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: The objects in the outer solar system have the unique property of not having been messed with very much. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All the planets on the inside of the solar system have been heated, smashed, had their orbits pushed around, and so on. But on the very edge, there’s just not as much out there to mess with things. The sunlight isn’t very hot, and they can preserve these very delicate records of what happened at the beginning of the solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Planet Nine is actually an example, and not one I ever thought we’d get. The fact that we can find another planet out there based on the very subtle gravitational influence it has is because everything is so pristine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astronomers say they have evidence of a ninth planet in our solar system. Here's what they say they know about it. (Joel Achenbach,Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: When you discovered the dwarf planet Eris, at what point did you realize Pluto was in trouble? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: Oh, within 15 seconds. I was sitting — I'm actually sitting in the same chair right now — I was looking at data, and the only reason it took 15 seconds was that for the first 14 I was thinking, no, this can't be right; there's nothing this bright in the sky. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then I did a quick calculation to see how big this object was and — we didn't know exactly how big it was at the time, but it was clearly the size of Pluto or much bigger. Either this was going to be a new planet, or Pluto was in trouble. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: A lot of people got excited when New Horizons found that Pluto is probably larger than Eris, for exactly that reason. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: Eris is significantly more massive — 25 percent more massive. If you take Pluto and you add every single object in the asteroid belt to it, you get to the mass of Eris. Pluto is bigger by volume, but it's just puffed up with extra ice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: So size isn't really the thing to get hung up on? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: It's good for bragging rights, but it doesn't actually mean anything. They're both so much smaller than anything else we'd call a planet. In the end, it doesn't matter that Eris exists. Eris isn't the problem with Pluto. Pluto is the problem with Pluto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: What made you take on the title of \"Pluto Killer\" willingly? Any regrets? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: It all happened kind of accidentally back in the early days of Twitter. I thought, oh, I should try it, and I needed a name and just thought being Pluto Killer would be funny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Laughing] Be careful what you use, because that's going to follow you forever. I can say it was not really a calculated statement at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: Do the Pluto fans ever make it personal? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: I think that there are people who would still love for Pluto to be a planet, and they wish people who kept reminding them why it’s not would be quiet and go home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Personally, I think it actually matters. I think that for people understanding the solar system as it really is, that's really important. So I have not been willing to back down and give up, and there are certainly people who don't like that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: And now you haven't just killed Pluto, you're trying to replace it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: My daughter — she's still kind of mad about Pluto being demoted, even though she was barely born at that time — she suggested a few years ago that she'd forgive me if I found a new planet. So I guess I've been working on this for her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An artist's impression of Planet Nine, which could sit at the edge of our solar system. (Caltech/R. Hurt) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: Speaking of Planet Nine, at what point can we actually say the planet has been \"discovered\"? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: In the end, discovery means it’s been seen. Someone has seen it, has seen it move, has seen the orbit. We think we know the orbit, but we don't know where on that orbit the planet is, and we haven't seen it yet. This paper we published is like handing everyone a treasure map. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's going to depend on the luck of the person who points the telescope in the right place first. It's going to take a lot of hard work, sure, but also a lot of luck. It might not be us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WP: But if you do get naming rights, what name are you going to propose for Planet Nine? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MB: This would only be the third planetary discovery in modern history [note: not counting Pluto!]. Naming it just seems too big for any one person. It just really seems like too big of a thing for the person who happens to have the luck of pointing the telescope. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would be a huge cultural moment. It shouldn't just be some guy saying, hey, I found it, so we're going to name it George. Which, by the way, is what William Herschel tried to do when he discovered Uranus.

Here's what they say they know about it. (Joel Achenbach,Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology announced Wednesday that they have found new evidence of a giant icy planet lurking in the darkness of our solar system far beyond the orbit of Pluto. They are calling it \"Planet Nine.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their paper, published in the Astronomical Journal, estimates the planet's mass as five to 10 times that of the Earth. But the authors, astronomers Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have not observed the planet directly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead, they have inferred its existence from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. Those smaller bodies have orbits that appear to be influenced by the gravity of a hidden planet – a \"massive perturber.\" The astronomers suggest it might have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Telescopes on at least two continents are searching for the object, which on average is 20 times farther away than the eighth planet, Neptune. If \"Planet Nine\" exists, it's big – about two to four times the diameter of the Earth, which would make it the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. But at such extreme distances, it would reflect so little sunlight that it could evade even the most powerful telescopes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Q&A: The ‘Pluto Killer’ who thinks he’s found the true ninth planet] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Confirmation of its existence would reconfigure the models of the solar system. Pluto, discovered in 1930, spent three-quarters of a century as the iconic ninth planet. Then, a decade ago, Pluto received a controversial demotion, in large part because of Brown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His observations of the outer solar system identified many small worlds there – some close to the size of Pluto – and prompted the International Astronomical Union to reconsider the definition of a planet. The IAU voted to change Pluto's classification to \"dwarf planet,\" a decision mocked repeatedly last summer when NASA's New Horizons probe flew past Pluto and revealed a world with an atmosphere, weather and a volatile and dynamically reworked surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown, who tweets under the handle @plutokiller and who wrote the book \"How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming,\" said now may be the time to rewrite the textbooks yet again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My daughter, she's still kind of mad about Pluto being demoted, even though she was barely born at that time,\" Brown said. \"She suggested a few years ago that she'd forgive me if I found a new planet. So I guess I've been working on this for her.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Is there a Planet X, a ‘massive perturber,’ hidden beyond Pluto?] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, cautioned Wednesday that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system. He referenced the famous dictum from Carl Sagan that \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Sagan Rule applies. If it's there, find it. I challenge you. Somebody out there oughta find it,\" Green said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he said he was personally excited about the new research: \"What an era we're in, where we’re discovering new things about our solar system that we never thought possible even a handful of years ago.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown and Batygin initially set out to prove that Planet Nine didn't exist. Their paper builds on earlier research by two other astronomers that revealed a peculiar clustering of the small, icy objects discovered in the past decade or so in the remote regions of the solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Nah, this possible new ninth planet isn’t Pluto] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2014, Scott Sheppard of the Washington-based Carnegie Institution of Science and Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii published a paper in the journal Nature that discussed the potential existence of a giant planet affecting the orbits of those dwarf worlds. Sheppard and Trujillo noted a similarity in the motion of those bodies when they are closest to the sun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown said, explaining that extra planets are always the \"go-to suggestion\" when astronomers find orbital behavior they can't explain. But he and Batygin struggled to debunk that hypothetical ninth planet. They used mathematical equations and then computer models, ultimately concluding that the best explanation for the smaller objects' clustering was the gravitational effects of something far bigger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Such clustering is similar to what's seen in some asteroids that are about as close to the sun as the Earth. They wind up in stable orbits that keep them far from Earth and free from any significant disturbance by the Earth's gravity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin stand for a portrait in front of an artist portrayal of Planet Nine at Caltech (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon for The Washington Post) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Until then, we didn't really believe our results ourselves. It just didn't make sense to us,\" Brown said. But their modeling showed that a planet with 10 times the mass of Earth would exert an influence over the orbits of the smaller bodies and keep them from coming as close to the sun as they should. It would also slowly twist these orbits by 90 degrees, making them periodically perpendicular to the plane of the solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In the back of my head, I had this nagging memory that someone had found some of these modulating objects and not known what to make of them,\" Brown said. \"And sure enough, these objects do exist. And they were exactly where our theory predicts they should be.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's when the Caltech researchers started to take Planet Nine seriously. \"That was the real jaw-dropping moment, when it went from a cute little idea to something that might be for real,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [NASA estimates 1 billion ‘Earths’ in our galaxy alone] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheppard, who co-wrote the paper that Brown and Batygin set out to disprove, says the existence of a hidden planet is still a big unknown. \"Until we actually see it for real, it will always be questionable as to whether it exists,\" he said, cautioning that the latest calculations are based on a relatively small number of known objects and that further observations and detections of perturbed bodies would bolster the hypothesis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Sheppard significantly upped the odds of discovery – from 40 percent before to 60 percent now. “Some people took it seriously, but a lot of people didn’t,\" he said of his own study's findings. \"With this new work, it’s much more rigorous, and people will take it more seriously now.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brown said he puts the odds of Planet Nine being real as \"maybe 90 percent.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From the Côte d'Azur Observatory in Nice, France, planetary scientist Alessandro Morbidelli agreed that the evidence was stronger this time. \"I immediately felt that this paper, for the first time, was providing convincing evidence for a new planet in the solar system,\" said Morbidelli, an expert in these kinds of orbital movements who was not involved in either study. \"I don't see any alternative explanation to that offered by Batygin and Brown.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We will find it one day,\" he added. \"The question is when.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The past two decades have seen a burst of discoveries as astronomers have scrutinized the light of distant stars and looked for signs of orbiting planets. More than a thousand such planets have been detected through analysis of starlight that has traveled across the vast interstellar distances. Brown and Batygin, however, have been searching closer to home, looking for objects that orbit the sun and remain unseen only because the outer regions of the solar system are exceedingly dark. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Scientists caught a new planet forming for the first time ever] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The thought of a hidden planet larger than Earth is intriguing, but for now it's difficult to say too much about the hypothetical conditions there. Brown believes it's probably an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas – a planet that could have been the core of a gas giant had it not been ejected into a wonky, highly elliptical orbit. It might not make its closest approach of the sun more than once every 10,000 years, and even then it would remain far beyond the known planets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The situation mimics what happened in the 19th century when careful observation of the seventh planet, Uranus, indicated that there must be another body in far-distant space influencing its orbit. That work led eventually to the discovery of Neptune. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would be difficult to see the ninth planet if it's not at or near its closest approach to the sun. Brown doesn't believe the object is at that point, saying it would have been spotted by now. But he does think that the most powerful telescopes on the planet, if pointed in precisely the right direction, might be able to detect it even when it is most distant from the sun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've been looking for it for a while now, but the sky is pretty big,\" Brown said. \"We know its path, but not where it is on that path.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He and Batygin hope their paper's publication will infuse the search with new energy. \"If other people – better astronomers – get excited about the idea of finding Planet Nine, we could hopefully see it within a couple of years,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two know they may not get credit for that discovery. Until the planet is spotted directly with a telescope, any work surrounding it is theoretical. Brown, Batygin and other scientists who have made the case for Planet Nine's existence are providing treasure maps and clues – but someone else could very well strike gold before they do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If and when it's spotted, Planet Nine would be evaluated by the same criteria that got Pluto demoted. Brown isn't concerned about that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That's not even a question -- it's definitely a planet,\" he said. One of the trickiest criteria for planet status, based on the standards set by the International Astronomical Union, is that a planet must \"clear the neighborhood\" around its orbital zone. It needs to have the gravitational prowess to change the orbits of other objects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Planet Nine is forcing any objects that cross its orbit to push into these misaligned positions. It fits that concept perfectly,\" Brown said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"Pluto killer\" added: \"Not to mention the fact that it's 5,000 times the mass of Pluto.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1 of 22 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × 22 stunning photos of our solar system and beyond in 2016 View Photos A look at the best photos of space.

(AP) — Scientists say they finally have \"solid evidence\" for Planet X, a true ninth planet on the fringes of our solar system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gas giant is thought to be almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles beyond Neptune's path — distant enough to take 10,000 to 20,000 years to circle the sun. This Planet 9, as the two Caltech researchers call it, hasn't been spotted yet. They base their findings on mathematical and computer modeling, and anticipate its discovery via telescope within five years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two reported on their research Wednesday in the Astronomical Journal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once it's detected, the researchers insist there will be no Pluto-style planetary debate. They ought to know; one of them, Mike Brown, is the so-called Pluto killer.\nPassage 4:\nImage copyright SPL Image caption Pluto killer: Prof Mike Brown says he has no regrets about his role in Pluto's demotion NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New Horizons flyby has renewed calls for Pluto to be reinstated into the club of planets from which it was unceremoniously dumped in 2006. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Dr Mike Brown of Caltech in Pasadena, who rejoices in the sobriquet of \"the man who killed Pluto\" told BBC News that those arguing for its reinstatement should stop living in the past. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people you hear most talking about reinstatement are those who are involved in the (New Horizons) mission. It is emotionally difficult for them,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those involved in the New Horizons mission want Pluto to be a planet because they want to be flying to a planet.

They would be far better off embracing the reality that it is not a planet and being excited about the fact that they are going to a new type of object in the outer Solar System.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Coup de grace NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Calls for Pluto to be downgraded intensified after a candidate Kuiper Belt object was discovered in 1992. Some argued that Pluto was simply the first resident of this outer Solar System region to be discovered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the coup de grace was delivered by Prof Brown with his discovery of the dwarf planet Eris in January 2005. It was like Pluto but more massive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was one of the finds that eventually led the International Astronomical Union to set up a committee to examine how planets should be defined. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright FRIEDRICH SAURER/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption An artist's impression of Eris; its discovery did much to force the issue over Pluto's planet status NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The IAU was forced to decide in 2006 whether it would admit Eris and other small worlds like Ceres, or boot out Pluto. It was a choice of one or the other - the status quo was not an option. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prof Brown argues that had the IAU had decided to keep Pluto as a planet and enrol Eris, it would eventually find itself having to consider the candidacies of hundreds, possibly thousands of wannabe planets.

It is really no good keeping Pluto and classifying it as one of the major objects because it is just not,\" he told BBC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So how did Prof Brown feel the day he heard that Pluto had been demoted? Was it a moment of joy, or was he wracked with guilt? He told me he felt it was more like a cold-blooded mercy killing necessary for the good of science. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It had been clear to me for some years that Pluto had been wrongly classified. So I was quite happy with the idea (of demoting Pluto) that we could go back and fix those mistakes,\" Prof Brown explained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No regrets NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pluto's demotion continues to be acrimonious. Many scientists say that it should remain a planet, arguing that it looks like a planet, behaves like a planet and has been thought of as a planet for three quarters of a century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I asked Mike Brown whether he had any regrets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No, no regrets. But I am sad about the way the last decade has gone since Pluto's demotion. I wish that people had embraced Pluto's status as an interesting member of the Kuiper Belt rather than the discussion of whether Pluto was a planet or not,\" he explained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When I met Mike Brown for the first time at a scientific meeting, there was a gleam in his eye - more mischievous than murderous - when I greeted him by saying: \"You're the guy who killed Pluto.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When I spoke to him this week, I put it to him that he seems to relish in the title, indeed he uses it himself on his website, and his book is called \"How I killed Pluto and why it had it coming\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He told me that it was intended as a clever joke but no one really understood it at the time.

I want people to understand what the Solar System is really like and if outrageously calling myself 'Pluto killer' helps then I'm happy with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hate mail NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Brown still gets hate mail on Twitter, mostly - he says - from people who had learned that Pluto was a planet at school. But he says that children who have grown up with the idea of Pluto not being a planet are comfortable with the idea. He believes that the controversy will gradually die down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Sun and the Moon used to be (thought of as) planets too but then we got over that a long time ago.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many have been held for decades. Rebel leaders based here estimate that during the six-month-long conflict, nearly 60,000 more Libyans had disappeared. Even as they continue their search for Gaddafi, the rebels have opened his prisons in Tripoli, freeing thousands.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1996, after inmates at Abu Salim revolted over their living conditions, 1,200 of them were massacred. And it was the arrest in February of a lawyer representing the families of those killed in 1996 that helped spark the uprising, which started in Benghazi and spread across the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After reuniting with his family members Sunday, Abdul Rauf told them that he was beaten and jabbed with electric prods every morning, from dawn until 10 o’clock, when he got a small piece of bread, some cheese, and, sometimes, a hard-boiled egg to share among six people. The first seven days, Abdul Rauf said, he was not allowed to use the bathroom and was given a bottle to use as a latrine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He shared a small cell with 70 people, all sleeping on the floor, and he told men who had been locked up for years what was happening outside the prison’s iron gates and towering walls.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Muneer Masoud Own, 33, who made a living doing manual labor, said forces loyal to longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi slaughtered nearly 150 prisoners as rebels closed in on Tripoli last week.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In early August, Muneer Own said, he and his 30-year-old brother were walking toward their grandfather's home when pro-Gadhafi forces detained them for reasons that were not explained. He said they were handcuffed, blindfolded and put into a warehouse with about 60 others who ranged in age from 17 to 70. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the next 18 days, Gadhafi's forces kept bringing detainees, Own said. Soon, about 175 people were crammed inside the warehouse, near the headquarters of the Libyan military's 32nd Brigade -- a much-feared unit led by one of Gadhafi's sons, Khamis.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers found that people with coronary heart disease who had experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than people who experienced little change in body weight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lead study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore, of the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York, and colleagues recently reported their results in the New England Journal of Medicine.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A number of studies have documented the possible health risks of yo-yo dieting. One study reported by Medical News Today last year, for example, uncovered a link between weight cycling and greater risk of death from heart disease.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Coronary heart disease (CHD) - also referred to as coronary artery disease - is the most common form of heart disease among men and women in the United States. Each year, the condition kills more than 370,000 people in the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CHD is characterized by atherosclerosis - the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which are those that supply the heart with oxygen-rich blood. This plaque buildup may block the blood supply to the heart, which can lead to angina (severe chest pain) or heart attack.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Subjects with the greatest changes in body weight experienced a weight fluctuation of up to 3.9 kilograms (around 8.6 pounds) during follow-up, while those with the smallest body weight changes had weight fluctuations of 0.9 kilograms (around 2 pounds).

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Nevada parole board decided Simpson should be freed after the former NFL star apologized for his role in a 2007 armed robbery, said he'd been a model prisoner, and promised that he'd have no conflicts if released. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson's appearance before the board garnered wall-to-wall coverage from cable news shows, coverage that recalled the \"trial of the century,\" and the many months more than 20 years ago when it transfixed a nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I've done my time,\" Simpson said. \"I've done it as well and as respectfully as I think anyone can.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now 70, Simpson's energy seemed little affected by his time behind bars. He was alert, engaged, and quick to smile, even letting out a hearty laugh when parole board Chairman Connie Bisbee accidentally said he was aged 90. \"I feel like it,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson has served nine years of a nine-to-33-year sentence for an armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas. He is expected to be released as early as October -- and said he plans to move to his home in Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An entire generation of Americans has come of age since Simpson seemed an almost inescapable public figure. But for one afternoon, it felt like 1995 again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was the year he was acquitted of murder charges in the grisly slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday's parole hearing followed renewed interest in his story, which was explored last year in the award-winning documentary \"O.J.: Made in America\" and the FX true-crime drama \"The People v. O.J. Simpson.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though it's been 22 years since the not guilty verdict, the murder trial's themes of criminal justice and race, trust in police, celebrity and domestic violence remain remarkably resonant in modern culture. \"We talk about O.J. as though the story is O.J.,\" journalist Celia Farber says toward the end of the \"Made in America\" documentary. \"The story is O.J. and us.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parole board vote unanimous NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For his part, Simpson seemed remarkably unaltered.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Juice,\" as he was known in his heyday, said associates misled him during the Vegas robbery and then turned on him in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of those associates is Tom Riccio. Simpson testified that Riccio is the one who called him, persuading him to take part in the robbery. Simpson said Thursday he regretted ever taking Riccio's call. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, according to Riccio, Simpson did a lot more than that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He should wish he didn't make all those calls after my call,\" Riccio told CNN. \"After he took my call he did a lot of things he shouldn't have done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riccio added that Simpson was the one who orchestrated the robbery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He plotted it all and gathered up men with guns.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson said Riccio avoided punishment by throwing him under the bus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Unfortunately, they got a get-out-of-jail-free card when they said 'O.J. told me (to do it),'\" Simpson said. \"Nothing I can do about that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sufficient remorse is not a relevant factor for parole, and Simpson ticked off several mitigating factors that made him a good candidate for release. He was discipline-free in prison, he has stable release plans, he has family and community support -- and, of course, he has no prior criminal convictions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The four parole board members voted unanimously to grant him parole, and board member Tony Corda said he was graded a \"low risk to reoffend.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson smiled, said \"thank you,\" and then put his head down for a few moments silently.

TRUMP: Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it's great. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3) Trump also used the question about fake news as an opportunity to criticize the ratings of CNN, saying he no longer watches the network because of its “anger and hatred.�? At one point, CNN’s Jim Acosta began trying to ask a question before Trump told his employer to be “straight.�? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: I mean, I watch CNN, it’s so much anger and hatred, and just the hatred. I don’t watch it anymore because it’s not very good. ... I think it should be straight. I think it should be — I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually — I think that’d actually be better. I don’t watch it any more because it’s very good — he’s saying no. It’s OK, Jim. It’s OK, Jim, you’ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You’re not the only one so don’t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be — I think it would be frankly more interesting NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4) At another point in the press conference, Trump explained why he wouldn’t explain whether he will retaliate against reports of Russian provocation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I'm not going to tell you anything about what I’m going to do. I'm not going to talk about military stuff. I will not say, “We are going to attack Mosul in four months. We are going to attack in one month. Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.�? In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult — you know why? I don't talk about military and certain other things. You were going to be surprised to hear that, by the way, my whole campaign I said that. I don't have to tell you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 5) Trump was also asked whether by attacking “fake news,�? he’d be undermining the press. It’s hard to summarize his answer, which touched on the negativity of the press, the importance of the institution, and whether he’d be a good reporter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR REPORTER: When you call it \"fake news,\" you're undermining confidence in our news media. ... TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here's the thing. Okay. I understand what you're — and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I'll say, \"Wow, that's going to be a great story.\" And I'll get killed ... But I know what's good. I know what's bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive — sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make okay. They'll even make it negative. So I understand it. So, because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who's saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me. Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press — the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 6) At another point, Trump talked about how the press would misrepresent the press conference he was giving. He said that he was not “ranting and raving,�? but that the media coverage would say he had been. (The precise wording of the question in the exchange below is unclear.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people. That's for sure. But I'm having a good time. Tomorrow, they will say, \"Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.\" I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it. But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, \"Donald Trump rants and raves.\" I'm not ranting and raving. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 7) Trump was also asked if “there was anything�? he could reveal to convince the media and public that the leaks over Russia and Flynn amounted to “fake news.�? He began by citing a Rasmussen poll showing his approval rating north of 50 percent, before talking about the dangers of uranium and how Hillary Clinton had a “stupid plastic button�? as part of her Russian reset. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia. Just so you understand that. Tomorrow, you will say, \"Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia; this is terrible.\" It is not terrible. It is good. We had Hillary Clinton try to do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? It’s this thing called nuclear weapons. And other things. Like lots of things are done with uranium. Including some bad things. But nobody talks about that. I did not do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 8) Later, Trump was asked if Vladimir Putin was “testing�? him with military provocations. Trump’s response included a warning about how nuclear war “would be like no other�?: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along — and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are they. There's no upside. We're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9) In one of his most relaxed moments, Trump ruminated on a career he decided not to pursue. “I'd be a pretty good reporter,�? he said. “Not as good as you.�?\nPassage 2:\nPresident Donald Trump seemed at varying points exasperated, energized, amicable and aggressive as he sparred with reporters Thursday. | Getty All the things Trump covered at his epic news conference The president went over a lot of ground during his 80-minute impromptu performance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Donald Trump held court with reporters for 80 minutes Thursday, producing no shortage of news in his first solo press conference as commander in chief. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facing a host of issues and controversies that have swirled around his administration in the four weeks since he inherited the White House, Trump confronted them, seeming at varying points exasperated, energized, amicable and aggressive as he sparred with reporters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Story Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here are the key moments from the president’s exchanges on a range of topics: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR OBAMA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “To be honest, I inherited a mess,” Trump said, blaming former President Barack Obama for handing off what Trump claimed was “a mess.” “We’ll take care of it, folks,” he added. “We’re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess. Beginning on Day One, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR OBAMACARE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said Republicans are in the final stage of repealing and replacing Obamacare, setting mid- to early March as a timeline to submit a plan. “We should be submitting the initial plan in March — early March — I would say,” Trump said. “And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It’s not like — quite frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion. But for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons we have to submit the health care sooner. So we’ll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RUSSIA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump said he did not direct former national security adviser Michael Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador. “I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple,” he told reporters. “Mike [Flynn] was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it. I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There’s no comparison between WikiLeaks and U.S. government leaks, Trump said. “When WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information,” he said. “They’re giving stuff — what was said in an office about Hillary cheating on the debates, which, by the way, nobody mentions.” One case involves “highly classified information,” Trump said, while the other is “John Podesta saying bad things about his boss.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hillary Clinton’s “stupid plastic button” made Americans look like “a bunch of jerks.” Clinton in 2009 gave the Russian foreign minister a red button as a gift to represent the reset between both nations. The button, however, misspelled the Russian word for “reset” on it, instead having the word for “overcharged.” “Hillary Clinton did a reset — remember — with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. ‘Here, take a look.’ He looked at her like, ‘What the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?’” Trump said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles offshore right out of the water,” Trump said, referring to a Russian spy ship spotted off the coast of Connecticut. “Everyone in this country’s gonna say, ‘Oh, it’s so great.’ That’s not great. That’s not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not good, not good, not good, the president said as a reporter mentioned the Russian spy ship found on the East Coast of the U.S., North Korea’s recent test-launch of a ballistic missile and a Russian plane that buzzed a U.S. Navy ship before delivering a bizarre response. “When did it happen? It happened when — if you were Putin right now, you would say: ‘Hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States. There’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because’ — you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now — just brutal — you would say, ‘Oh, isn’t that wonderful.’ But I know you well enough. Then you would say: ‘Aww, he was too tough. He shouldn’t have done that.’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Nuclear holocaust would be like no other,” Trump said. He stressed that it’s OK if the U.S. got along with Russia and said he wants to do the right thing for the American people and, secondarily, the world. “Don’t forget: We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they,” he added. “There’s no upside. We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I’ve been briefed, and I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Does anyone believe Clinton would be tougher on Russia, Trump asked incredulously. “Does anybody in this room really believe that?” Trump said, noting Clinton’s attempted reset with Russia as secretary of state. “They say I’m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States,” Trump said. “She’s close to Russia. You know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump won’t telegraph his moves. “I’m not gonna tell you anything about what response I do. I don’t talk about military response,” Trump said, refusing to publicly state a potential response to the Russian spy ship spotted off the coast of Connecticut or North Korea’s test-launch of a ballistic missile over the weekend. He went on to mock past administrations for announcing their every move. “I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, ‘Yes, here’s what we’re going to do,” Trump said with glee. “I don’t have to do that. I don't have to tell you what I’m gonna do in North Korea. And I don’t have to tell you what I’m gonna do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn’t know, and eventually you guys are gonna get tired of asking that.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Russia was a ruse,” the president charged. Aside from speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin twice since winning the election, Trump maintained that he has nothing to do with the Kremlin and hasn’t even made a call there in years. “We had a very good talk, especially the second one — lasted for a pretty long period of time,” Trump said of his calls with Putin. “I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified so I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it, but we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DISCRIMINATION NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No one is less racist or anti-Semitic than Trump, according to the president. “No. 1, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your life,” he told a reporter. Trump, however, drew widespread condemnation last month for omitting the slaughtering of 6 million Jews in his Holocaust Remembrance statement, although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday declared at a joint news conference that “there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump.” “No. 2, racism,” Trump continued. “The least racist person … I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. I hate even the question.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR IMMIGRATION NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blame Homeland Security Secretary James Kelly for the travel ban executive order rollout, which the president insisted was “very smooth” and “perfect,” actually, despite it causing chaos at airports and sparking massive protests. Trump said a “bad court” made a “bad decision” when it blocked his executive action from being enforced nationwide and added that he would introduce a new order next week. Trump said he wanted to give a month’s heads-up. “But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said if you do that all these people will come in the month — the bad ones. You do agree there are bad people out there right, that not everybody [is] like you?” he asked. “You have some bad people out there, so Kelly said you can’t do that, and he was right. … Now if I would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect. The problem is we would have wasted a lot of time and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would have come into the country.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We are gonna deal with DACA with heart,” Trump pledged, softening his position on undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Casting what to do with the program as a very difficult decision for a father and grandfather who loves children, Trump conceded that it’s tough for him to follow the law on that issue but argued that while some of the children who come in join gangs and deal drugs, many are “absolutely incredible.” “I have to deal with a lot of politicians — don’t forget — and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is right,” he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MEDIA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president blasted media from all over the country, accusing outlets from Washington, New York and Los Angeles, specifically, of speaking “not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.” He maintained that the press is dishonesty, which he added was “out of control.” Trump credited his administration for its “incredible progress” in just one month. “I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done,” he said. “I turn on the TV, open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The media with hatred, Trump charged. The public, Trump argued, may not be able to discern what’s true when they read reports, but he knows what’s real and what’s fake. “I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not,” the president said. “I just see many, many untruthful things. And I’ll tell you what else I see: I see tone. You know the word: tone. The tone is such hatred.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump revised his characterization of CNN, which he often derides as fake news. “I’m changing it from fake news, though,” he told CNN’s Jim Acosta, pausing for emphasis. “Very fake news. … And you’re not related to our new — you know, I looked at that name,” Trump said, referencing his newly named labor secretary nominee, Alexander Acosta. “I said: ‘Wait a minute. Is there any relation there, Alex?’ No, I checked it. They said, ‘No, sir.’ I said, ‘Do me a favor and go back and check the family tree.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’d be a pretty good reporter,” the president mused at one point. Trump contended that he knows when he should get a good or bad story but accused the media of often turning “positive” stories into “negative” or “OK” articles. “I understand it. Because I’m there,” Trump said. “I know what was said, who’s saying it. I’m there. So it’s very important to me. Look, I want to see an honest press. … It’s so important to the public to get an honest press. The public doesn’t believe you people anymore. Now maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president disputed media reports of a White House in chaos, insisting there’s “zero chaos” in his “fine-tuned machine” of an administration and that “half” of chief of staff Reince Priebus’ job consists of “putting out lies by the press.” “He’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. I mean, they’re fake,” Trump said. “They’re not true. And isn’t that a shame? Because he’d rather be working on health care. He’d rather be working on tax reform.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump called out for a “friendly reporter” after tense exchanges with reporters. “I want to find a friendly reporter. Are you a friendly reporter?” Trump asked. “Watch how friendly he is.” Trump wasn’t a fan of the unfinished question, which delved into an uptick of anti-Semitic threats and how the administration planned to address them. “He said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question, and it’s not,” Trump said. “It’s not. It’s not a simple question, not a fair question. OK, sit down. I understand the rest of your question.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Now that’s what I call a nice question,” Trump said moments later, praising a UNF News reporter who inquired about first Lady Melania Trump’s decision to open the White House visitor’s office. “Thank you very much.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Do you want to set up the meeting?” Trump asked April Ryan, a black reporter who covers the White House for American Urban Radio Networks. Ryan asked the president if he would speak to congressional black and Hispanic caucuses about his agenda for urban areas and inner cities. “No, no, no, I’m just a reporter,” she said to Trump, who in turn asked if the lawmakers were friends of hers. “Set up the meeting. Let’s go,” he told Ryan. “Set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the black caucus.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CABINET NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump opened his news conference by announcing his new nominee to head the Labor Department: Alexander Acosta. “He’s a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board and has been through Senate confirmations three times — confirmed, did very, very well,” Trump said. “So Alex, I wished him the best. We just spoke and he’s going to be — I think he’ll be a tremendous secretary of labor.” Trump’s former nominee, Andrew Puzder, withdrew his nomination Wednesday after Senate Republicans informed the White House that Puzder lacked the votes to be confirmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ISLAMIC STATE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump has ordered the Pentagon to submit a plan to defeat the Islamic State, he said, noting that Defense Secretary James Mattis is “over there now working very hard.” Trump described the Islamic State as a “small group” that has burgeoned and “celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world.” “They’ve spread like cancer,” in the president’s words. “ISIS has spread like cancer. Another mess I inherited.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ELECTORAL COLLEGE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump wasn’t supposed to win, he reminded reporters. “I wasn’t supposed to get 222 [Electoral College votes]. They said, ‘There’s no way to get 222 — 230 is impossible. 270, which you need — that was laughable,” Trump said. “We got 306. Because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before. So that’s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.” Some of Trump’s claims, however, are false. Obama won 332 electoral votes in 2012, and Trump only received 304 votes in the Electoral College due to a couple of faithless electors who voted against him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DRUGS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars,” Trump said. He announced that he has instructed the homeland security and justice departments “to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs.” The U.S. is “becoming a drug-infested nation,” he said, promising to curb the flow of drugs.\nPassage 3:\nJeffrey Lord on CNN with Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer (CNN/YouTube) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Donald Trump’s Thursday press conference had many people talking. Addressing the latest White House scandal involving former national security advisor Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump said “Russia is fake news” noting later, “the leaks are absolutely real, the news is fake.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In reality, Trump gave a weapons-grade crazy 77-minute press conference. However, CNN contributor and Trump supporter Jeffrey Lord had a different take on that “meltdown.” Speaking with CNN hosts Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer, Lord said, “I think we saw two different press conferences.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “From my perspective, I thought he was relaxed, he was funny, he was on point. He took the whole issue of the media, and he had a very candid conversation,” Lord said. “This is the kind of conversation that I personally had with him a couple years ago in which he said some version of this same thing that he said today, except he was more specific.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lord described the president as “candid, very dedicated to the job, very in command.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What about some of the back and forth that he had with reporters? You used to work in the Reagan White House — is that really presidential four weeks into a new term?” Blitzer asked. “I think this is going to be his presidential style,” Lord replied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tapper later mentioned a reporter from NBC who called out President Trump for incessantly calling the media “fake news” while also “saying things that are not true,” noting the reporter was asking, “How do you have credibility to call us fake news?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think it was a simple mistake,” replied Lord, calling the reporter’s question “nitpicky.” He then proceeded to launch an attack on the network. “I had somebody here locally say to me during the campaign, you know, they recognized me, and they came over and they said — and it was a comment about CNN, which I’ll be happy to make on air here, just so you know,” Lord started. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He continued, “They said if Donald Trump sneezed, CNN would spend four days talking about his damage to the environment. That’s the kind of perception, not just about CNN, but about the media at large, and that’s the kind of feeling that he addresses.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watch the full clip below.\nPassage 4:\nFox News anchor Shepard Smith on Thursday criticized President Trump Donald John Trump Airstrikes hit Syria air base: Syrian state media Trump, Macron agree on 'strong, joint response' to alleged Syria chemical attack Trump congratulates Patrick Reed on Masters win MORE for bashing reporters gathered at a lengthy Thursday press conference, calling on him to answer legitimate questions from news outlets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"(Trump) keeps repeating ridiculous throwaway lines that are not true at all and sort of avoiding this issue of Russia as if we're some kind of fools for asking the question. Really?\" Smith said. \"Your opposition was hacked and the Russians were responsible for it and your people were on the phone with Russia on the same day it was happening and we're fools for asking the questions?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump was repeatedly asked by reporters from different publications about reported conversations between his campaign aides and Russian officials. Trump blasted such stories as \"fake news\" and berated journalists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Russia is fake news. Russia — this is fake news put out by the media,\" he said at one point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump maintained that he is not aware that any of his campaign aides had any improper communications with Russian officials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No sir,\" Smith continued. \"We are not fools for asking this question, and we demand to know the answer to this question. You owe this to the American people. Your supporters will support you either way. If your people were on the phone, what were they saying? We have a right to know, we absolutely do and that you call us fake news and put us down like children for asking these questions on behalf of the American people is inconsequential. The people deserve an answer to this question at very least.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith also defended CNN reporter Jim Acosta, who pressed Trump for answers on several points. Acosta and Trump have frequently sparred at past press conferences. Thursday Trump said he was upgrading CNN from \"fake news\" to \"very fake news.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith defended Acosta during the segment Thursday, calling him \"an accomplished reporter, a guy I've never met, but a good reporter.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jim Acosta thanked Smith for his defense in a tweet shortly after the segment aired. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During Thursday's press conference, Acosta told Trump, \"Just for the record, we don't hate you. I don't hate you,\" as he prefaced his question for the president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump shot back, “Ask [CNN President] Jeff Zucker how he got his job, OK?” adding that CNN’s ratings aren’t “good right now.”\nPassage 5:\nThe litany of misery wasn’t always consistent. On the one hand, “Jobs have already started to surge,” he said. On the other, “Jobs are pouring out of the country.” Trump’s doomsaying on the economy cut directly against a triumphant tweet Thursday morning, in which he boasted, “Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There’s been a boom in the cottage industry of diagnosing the president’s mental health from afar these days, the kind of thing that shouldn’t even be done by licensed professionals, much less amateurs. But it’s hard not to suspect that Trump isn’t having a lot of fun. He’s eyed the presidency for decades, and now that he’s in the White House, he seems deeply unhappy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And who can blame him? The administration is plagued by leaks, from rival factions sniping at each other within the West Wing to intelligence officials speaking for stories that have damaged the administration and brought down National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. (Yes, Virginia, that was this week, even though it feels like forever ago.) Trump’s signature immigration executive order has been halted by federal courts. The storied wall isn’t under construction, and Mexico still won’t pay. Several Cabinet spots remain unfilled. There’s little progress on repealing and replacing Obamacare. He is beginning to learn just how slowly the wheels of action turn in politics. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans have slowly begun to agitate for investigations into various questionable Trump moves. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump tried to insist everything was fine. “I turn on the TV, open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos,” he said. “Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my cabinet approved.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He argued that, in the face of the evidence, he had already accomplished much. “In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises,” he said. “Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His mood and words suggested otherwise. “I’m not ranting and raving,” he ranted and raved. There are other signs of frustration. Rather than spend weekends at the White House, he has made a habit of going to Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort where he apparently feels more comfortable. On Saturday, he’ll hold what his aides have described as a campaign rally, effectively starting his 2020 reelection race. These are excuses to leave Washington, but they also point to a president who misses the presidential campaign, when he was an underdog who kept beating expectations, and before he had to wrestle with the work of governing. That nostalgia manifested itself in a reverie about the election, and how no one thought he could win.\nPassage 6:\nPresident Donald Trump harkened back to the free-wheeling style of his unconventional 2016 Republican primary campaign in a 77-minute press conference Thursday during which he touted his poll numbers and took on the “dishonest media.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump harkened back to the free-wheeling style of his unconventional 2016 Republican primary campaign in a 77-minute press conference Thursday during which he touted his poll numbers and took on the “dishonest media.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Payback was in the air as the newly-elected president took on the role of media critic. He excoriated CNN for its poor ratings, mocked the BBC as “that’s another beauty,” and responded to a question about anti-Semitism, saying to his questioner, “OK, sit down, I understand the rest of your question.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ditching decorum and diplomacy, Trump told the press, “the public doesn’t believe you anymore.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president took on the White House press corps after a week of negative news. Monday night National Security Adviser Mike Flynn resigned after the Washington Post reported that a Justice official had told the White House Flynn was susceptible to blackmail because he had misled senior administration officials about a conversation with the Russian ambassador during the transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then the New York Times reported that unnamed U.S. officials believed some Trump backers were in contact with Russian intelligence officials during the 2016 campaign. Wednesday the Wall Street Journal ran a story that suggested intelligence officials were withholding information from the commander-in-chief. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Trump refused to take TV news reporters’ questions about Flynn and Russia at Wednesday’s joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, CNN’s Jim Acosta charged that Trump’s decision to call on only conservative and Christian media meant, “The fix is in.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a news conference called ostensibly to announce the nomination of law school dean Alexander Acosta as Labor Secretary, Trump joked to the CNN reporter that he had his staff “check the family tree” to make sure that his nominee with the same last name was not related. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You can’t say he’s not responsive to the press,” Alice Stewart, a former reporter and current CNN contributor, GOP strategist and Trump supporter, said after the news conference. “He answered all the questions from all over the press corps and put to rest the long-standing dialogue that he shuts down certain news outlets.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A week’s worth of pent up questions gushed forth at the briefing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Did Trump fire Flynn? Yes, but not for what he said to the Russian ambassador, but because Flynn withheld information from Vice President Mike Pence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump dismissed “the failing New York Times” story on alleged campaign contact with Russian officials as “a joke” and “fake news” — fabricated to explain away Democrat Hillary Clinton’s election loss. The problem, Trump contended, are leakers “probably from the Obama administration” who have been feeding classified information to the media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I said to myself,” said Trump, “‘What happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So how can Trump complain about leaks of from his shop when he said he loved Wikileaks when it was releasing e-mails from Clinton campaign operatives? The difference, said Trump, is that this week’s stories involve “highly-classified information” — not Clinton campaign chairman “John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At one point, Trump suggested that “false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As is his habit, Trump fudged a few facts himself – he said he won 306 electoral college votes, when in fact he won 304. He wrongly claimed that his win was “the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan,” when George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama fared better in the electoral college. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s just crazy,” opined former CNN correspondent Frank Sesno, author of the book, “Ask More: The Power of Questions to Open Doors, Uncover Solutions, and Spark Change.” “I know that this may scratch an itch that he has about the media and he feels this a really unfair situation and it may resonate with his base. This does not play well over time.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stewart is not so sure. “From a communications standpoint, I think attacking the media is not a smart move, but it’s worked for him,” she said. “His goal was to change the narrative and all you can say now is, ‘Mission accomplished.’” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On that point, Trump cited the latest Rasmussen poll, which found 55 percent of Americans approving of his performance in office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For his part, Sesno believes the optics are bad as Trump came across as overly obsessed with the media. “He’s certainly not winning over the skeptics and the fence sitters.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, however, thinks the optics are bad for those who cover him. “And I’ll tell you what else I see,” Trump said during the epic press conference. “I see tone. You know the word ‘tone.’ The tone is such hatred. I’m really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such — I do get good ratings, you have to admit that — the tone is such hatred.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the White House, however, Trump argued life is good. “I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos,” he said. “Chaos. Yet, it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Contact Debra J. Saunders at dsaunders@reviewjournal.com or at 202-662-7391.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Thursday made a messy case that he \"inherited a mess\" from his predecessor. Economic stats and territorial losses of Islamic State insurgents don't support his assertions about the problems handed to him on those fronts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A look at some of his claims in a news conference Thursday and how they compare with the facts: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: \"To be honest I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR THE FACTS: A mess is in the eye of the beholder. But by almost every economic measure, President Barack Obama inherited a far worse situation when he became president in 2009 than he left for Trump. He had to deal with the worst downturn since the Depression. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unemployment was spiking, the stock market crashing, the auto industry failing and millions of Americans risked losing their homes to foreclosure when Obama took the oath of office. None of those statistics is as dire for Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unemployment is 4.8 percent, compared with a peak of 10 percent during Obama's first year as president. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was cratering until March 2009, only to rebound roughly 200 percent over the rest of Obama's term— gains that have continued under Trump on the promise of tax and regulatory cuts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Trump assumed office last month, a greater percentage of the country had health insurance, incomes were rising and the country was adding jobs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Trump administration has noted that a smaller proportion of the population is working or looking for jobs. But even this measure began to turn around toward the end of the Obama era. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet it's true that jobs at factories and coal mines have been disappearing for more than three decades, while many Americans with only a high school diploma have seen their incomes fall after adjusting for inflation. The home ownership rate has slipped even as the economy has improved, leaving many pockets of the country feeling left out of a recovery that technically began more than seven years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: \"ISIS has spread like cancer, another mess I inherited.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR THE FACTS: The Islamic State group began to lose ground before Trump took office, not just in Iraq and Syria but also in Libya. The gradual military progress achieved in Iraq during Obama's final two years has pushed IS to the point of collapse in Mosul, its main Iraqi stronghold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It remains a potent danger beyond its shrunken territory, encouraging adherents to stage acts of terrorism. The analogy with cancer is an echo of Obama's last defense secretary, Ash Carter, who repeatedly cast Obama's counter-IS campaign as an effort to reverse the extremists' \"metastasis\" beyond the \"parent tumor\" in Iraq and Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: \"I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my Cabinet approved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR THE FACTS: Did he just say a \"fine-tuned machine\"? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump's first month has been consumed by a series of missteps and firestorms, and produced far less significant legislation than Obama enacted during his first month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican-led congressional committees will investigate the Trump team's relations with Russians before he took office and the flood of leaks that altogether forced out his national security adviser in record time. His pick for labor secretary withdrew because he didn't have enough Republican support. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By many measures, the administration is in near paralysis in its earliest days, leaving allies unsettled and many in Congress anxious about what Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., called the \"constant disruption.\" To many Republicans — never mind Democrats — the \"fine-tuned machine\" seems in danger of its wheels coming off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his first month, Obama signed a $787 billion stimulus package into law, as well as a law expanding health care for children and the Lilly Ledbetter bill on equal pay for women. Trump has vigorously produced executive orders, which don't require congressional approval and typically have narrow effect. The one with far-reaching consequences — banning entry by refugees and by visitors from seven countries — has been blocked by courts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump's biggest initiatives, such as tax cuts and a replacement for Obama's health care law, have not emerged. On Thursday he was signing into law a rollback of Obama-era regulations on mining near streams. Congress has sent him little else. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP, bragging again about his Electoral College vote total: \"We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before, so that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR THE FACTS: Not even close. In the seven previous elections, the winner of five of those contests won a larger Electoral College majority than Trump. They were George H.W. Bush in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996; and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When a reporter pointed out that Trump was overstating his winning margin, the president said: \"Well, I don't know, I was given that information.\" He then called it \"a very substantial victory.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump actually ended up with 304 electoral votes because of the defection of two electors in December, but he had won enough states in November to get to 306. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP, saying the appeals court that blocked his selective travel ban \"has been overturned at a record number.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR THE FACTS: Other appeals courts have seen their decisions overturned at a higher rate than the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit that froze his action on immigration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the most recent full term, the Supreme Court reversed 8 of the 11 cases from the 9th Circuit. But the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit went 0 for 3 — that is, the Supreme Court reversed all three cases it heard from that circuit. And over the past five years, five federal appeals courts were reversed at a higher rate than the 9th Circuit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 9th Circuit is by far the largest of the 13 federal courts of appeals. In raw numbers, more cases are heard and reversed from the 9th Circuit year in and year out. But as a percentage of cases the Supreme Court hears, the liberal-leaning circuit fares somewhat better, according to statistical compilations by Scotusblog. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most cases decided by appeals courts aren't appealed to the Supreme Court, and the high court only accepts for review a small percentage of those that are. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the very act of the Supreme Court's agreeing to hear a case means the odds are it will be overturned; the court reverses about two-thirds of the cases it hears.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today President Trump held his first full news conference since his inauguration. It was wide-ranging. It lasted more than an hour. And at times, it was pretty tense after a week of headlines about setbacks, controversy and chaos surrounding the White House. Today the president pushed back. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I mean it's - story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing - chaos. There's zero chaos. We are running - this is a fine-tuned machine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MCEVERS: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson was at the news conference and joins us now from the White House. Hi, Mara. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MCEVERS: So this news conference was announced with just about an hour's notice. What prompted it? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LIASSON: Well, ostensibly it was to announce his new labor secretary nominee, but that was really just a blip. I think it was about showing that he could do this. He stood there for almost 80 minutes. He took tough questions not just from friendly reporters. I think he wanted to seize back the narrative and defend his administration's accomplishments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And of course, as he often does, he provided his own real-time color commentary and tried to anticipate his next day's box office and work the refs all at the same time. Here's a little bit of that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press. I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you, you know, you're dishonest people. But I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LIASSON: This is the Donald Trump we got to know during the campaign. He was defensive. He was frustrated. He was aggrieved. He was combative. But he was also funny and charming like he was with the press during all those years in New York as a fixture in the tabloids. I am told he was pretty pleased with his performance today and that he is now in high spirits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MCEVERS: When the news up till now has been all about Russia. I mean let's start with the resignation of Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn. What'd he say about that? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LIASSON: Well, I got the first question, and I asked him about why he let Flynn go. He said it was because of what he did or didn't tell the vice president. Then I asked him why he had kept Vice President Pence in the dark for almost two weeks. Pence found out about Flynn misleading him from the media. And Trump seemed to say the reason he kept him in the dark was that he just didn't think what Flynn did was that big a deal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president also addressed stories alleging contacts between people associated with his campaign and Russian intelligence officials. He said, the leaks are real, but the news is fake. He said, I have nothing to do with Russia. And he was repeatedly asked about those contacts between his campaign officials and Russian officials, and he finally said, not that I know of. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MCEVERS: It wasn't all Russia and Flynn. What other news did the president make today? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LIASSON: He said that there will be an Obamacare replacement by mid-March. He's going to have a new executive order revising the travel ban next week that will be tailored to address the objections by the appeals court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MCEVERS: Any other moments stand out to you? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LIASSON: Yeah, there were so many of them. There was one when he was called out about using inaccurate numbers about how his Electoral College win compared to past presidents. He was asked why Americans should trust him when he keeps on providing information that isn't accurate. And he had to back off of that. He just said, well, I was given that information. And what that shows you is when a president stands up and opens himself up to real questions from the media and follow-ups, he can retreat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was also asked twice about anti-Semitic incidents - swastikas on Jewish centers, things like that - that were committed by his supporters sometimes in his name. And he blamed those incidents on his opponents. Here's what he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (SOUNDBITES OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TRUMP: They'll do signs, and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LIASSON: So not taking any responsibility for that at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MCEVERS: Now, before I let you go, Mara, I mean you were there in the room, like you said - I mean any takeaways about, like, the mood there? What was the feeling in the East Room? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LIASSON: Well, I don't think we've ever seen a presidential press conference performance like this one. It was really extraordinary. He pretty much put himself on the couch, inadvertently or not. I think that he will get a lot of credit for doing this. I think it will thrill his supporters. I think if he was trying to show nervous Republicans on Capitol Hill that he's in control, that the dysfunction they've been complaining about from the White House isn't real, as he said, we're like a well-oiled machine. Whether he truly calmed the waters or not after a chaotic first month remains to be seen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MCEVERS: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Donald Trump points to a member of the media as he takes questions during a news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON (AP) — The leaks are real. But the news about them is fake. The White House is a fine-tuned machine. Russia is a ruse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For its stunning moments and memorable one-liners, Donald Trump's first solo news conference as president has no rivals in recent memory. For all the trappings of the White House and traditions of the forum, his performance was one of a swaggering, blustery campaigner, armed with grievances and primed to unload on his favorite targets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In nearly an hour and a half at the podium, Trump bullied reporters, dismissed facts and then cracked a few caustic jokes — a combination that once made the candidate irresistible cable TV fodder. Now in office, he went even further, blaming the media for all but sinking his not-yet-launched attempt to \"make a deal\" with Moscow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That matters, Trump said in one of his many improvisational asides, because he'd been briefed and \"I can tell you ... nuclear holocaust would be like no other.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was his and his aides' attempt to get the boss his groove back. Trump used the event to try to claw his young administration back from the brink after a defeat in court and the forced resignation of his top national security adviser. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He taunted reporters and waved away their attempts to fact-check him in real time. He (incorrectly) touted his Electoral College total and repeatedly blasted his November opponent — somehow mentioning Hillary Clinton more than anyone else in his defense of his administration's early days. He bragged that his White House is \"a fine-tuned machine\" and claimed \"there has never been a presidency that has done so much in such a short period of time.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If only the news media would give him credit. Over and over, he accused the political press of being dishonest and suggested that any negative coverage of his administration was \"fake news.\" He unloaded a torrent of grievances while positioning himself as the stand-in for the everyman, who, he declared, hates and distrusts reporters as much as he does. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The press — the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don't know. But they don't believe you,\" Trump charged. \"But you've got to be at least a little bit fair, and that's why the public sees it. They see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hastily called news conference was not on the White House's original schedule for Thursday, and some of Trump's own aides were surprised when the president let slip at a morning meeting that he would hold the event in the East Room just hours later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The performance was vintage Trump, a throwback to the messy, zinger-filled news conferences he held during the early stages of his campaign. And, when combined with a rally slated for Saturday in Florida, it appeared to be the start of a one-two punch meant to re-energize a president whose White House in recent days has been buffeted by crisis and paralyzed by dysfunction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet it was a far cry from the \"buck stops here\" mantra popularized by Harry Truman and other presidents who believed that the ultimate responsibility for any White House struggles lay with the president himself. Trump was eager to assign blame elsewhere, ignoring the nation's healthy economy and relative peace when he took office to say \"to be honest, I inherited a mess, a mess, at home and abroad, a mess.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He mostly blamed the media for his woes, rebuffing suggestions that he was undermining confidence in the press or threatening the First Amendment by trying to convince the nation that \"the press honestly is out of control.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people,\" he said. \"Tremendous disservice.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Never before has a president stood in the White House and so publicly maligned the press or attacked reporters by name, according to presidential historians. Not even Richard Nixon in the days of Watergate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was bizarre theater,\" said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. \"He turned a presidential press conference into a reality TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But for Trump, it continued a defining theme and amplified his chief strategist Stephen Bannon's decree that the media are \"the opposition party.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump had put claims of press prejudice at the center of his campaign in an unprecedented way and earlier this month falsely accused the media of refusing to cover terrorist attacks across the world. Though Thursday's news conference was a messy, fact-challenged affair, it may well have been cheered by Trump supporters across the country who had packed arenas last year to jeer reporters and chant \"tell the truth\" at the press pen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An Associated Press-GfK poll taken on the eve of the election revealed that 87 percent of Trump's supporters saw the media as biased against him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump retains support among Republicans, and solid majorities of Americans say he is following through on his promises and is viewed as a strong leader, according to a Gallup survey. But his overall job approval rating is much lower than those of past presidents at the same point in their administrations. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 39 percent of Americans approve of his job performance while 56 percent disapprove. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For all of Trump's complaints, he appeared to delight in sparring with reporters in what was only his second news conference since last July. Several times he extended the event in order to field more questions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not that he answered them all. He dodged inquiries about his campaign's links to Russia and talked down several reporters before they could finish their questions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On one subject in the news, he did defend the national security adviser he recently fired. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he also made a point of complimenting a softball inquiry about the first lady as \"a very nice question.\" He teased CNN reporter Jim Acosta for having the same last name as his new pick for labor secretary — Alexander Acosta, whose appointment was ostensibly the reason for the news conference — and said he asked his staff to make sure the men weren't related. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were startling moments aplenty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He chided a Jewish reporter wearing a kippah for asking a question about anti-Semitism. He asked an African-American reporter whether she could help set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. He displayed a rare moment of introspection when he discussed his love for kids amid his \"very, very hard\" decision whether to potentially deport young immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But mostly it was Trump's bravado on display, as when he incorrectly asserted that his Electoral College victory had been the largest of any president since Ronald Reagan — and then simply dismissed a reporter's attempt to correct him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Well, I don't know, I was given that information,\" said Trump. \"But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire\n", "answers": ["President Trump ripped into the \"dishonest\" and \"out of control\" media during his press conference Thursday—and it didn't take long for the media to fire back.

Smith said Trump \"owes it to the American people\" to answer legitimate questions liked the ones about Russia that he dismissed as \"fake news.\" But not all the reviews were so negative. A look at coverage: Yes, he was \"combative,\" observes Mara Liasson at NPR, \"but he was also funny and charming like he was with the press during all those years in New York as a fixture in the tabloids. ...

Only George W. Bush won with fewer than Trump. \"I was given that information,\" Trump said when a reporter challenged him on the statement. The AP takes a close look at Trump's \"I inherited a mess line\" and decides the claim itself is messy. CNN contributor Jeffrey Lord, reacting to scathing reviews: “Lord, I think we saw two different press conferences,\" he said, per Raw Story. \"From my perspective, I thought he was relaxed, he was funny, he was on point. He took the whole issue of the media, and he had a very candid conversation.\" Politico has an exhaustive list of the topics Trump covered during the 77-minute presser, ranging from nuclear holocaust to CNN, which he downgraded from \"fake news\" to \"very fake news.\" BuzzFeed has video of one of the conference's most heavily commented upon moments: when Trump asked a black reporter if she could set up a meeting between him and the Congressional Black Caucus. Presidential historians tell the AP that no president, including Nixon during the Watergate scandal, has publicly turned on the press the way Trump did. \"It was bizarre theater,\" says Rice University history professor Douglas Brinkley. \"He turned a presidential press conference into a reality-TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.\" GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alice Stewart also found a few things to praise in Trump's performance. \"You can't say he's not responsive to the press,\" she tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \"He answered all the questions from all over the press corps and put to rest the long-standing dialogue that he shuts down certain news outlets.\" Vox lists nine moments that it suggests back up Jake Tapper's description of the press conference as \"wild\" and \"unhinged,\" including Trump's claim that \"the leaks are real\" but \"the news is fake.\" Late-night hosts approached the press conference as gleefully as a kid unwrapping Christmas presents, and the Washington Post rounds up some of their best lines. \"My guess is he did it because he's mad and he just wanted to blow off some steam,\" Jimmy Kimmel said. \"The tone of the press conference was like if your dad found a pack of cigarettes under your mattress.\" David Graham at the Atlantic looks at the continual theme of complaint in the conference and wonders: Does Trump hate his new job?"], "length": 10933, "dataset": "multi_news", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "6db3807942c349fe99398373caf4c32ebfd701082c314b09"}

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The situation doesn't represent a life-threatening emergency, but it has required a cutback in normal operations on the orbiting outpost, NASA spokesman Josh Byerly said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The crew was never in any danger,\" he said. \"They're fine for the near future.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The problem is one of the \"Big 14\" maintenance issues that NASA and its partners expect to face on an occasional basis during space station operations. \"This is the kind of thing that they expected to happen, at about the expected rate,\" NBC News space analyst James Oberg said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shutdown mode NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down when it reached a pre-set temperature limit on Wednesday, Byerly told NBC News. That forced NASA to reroute coolant into Loop-B. As a result, the station's six-person crew had to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems and science experiments — including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems were turned off in NASA's Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab and Europe's Columbus lab. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crew \"worked to keep the freezers going, \" Byerly said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Engineers think the problem was caused by a malfunctioning flow control valve for the station's ammonia coolant. Mission managers are trying to determine whether a software fix can get the valve working again, or whether a spacewalk will be required. Sorting through all the issues might take a couple of days, or as much as a couple of weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Routine maintenance NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It generally takes two weeks to plan for a \"Big 14\" repair operation, but that depends on the resources at hand and the urgency of the problem. In May, NASA astronauts mounted a spacewalk to replace a leaky coolant pump control box after just two days of planning. Spacewalkers also dealt with coolant system maintenance issues in 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2007. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. spacewalks were temporarily suspended after Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's spacesuit filled with water during a July outing, but Russian spacewalks have proceeded without problems. And since July, NASA has made significant progress on resolving the spacesuit problem that Parmitano faced. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are cleared for a contingency spacewalk if we need to do one,\" NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries told NBC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Americans, three Russians and a Japanese astronaut are living on the space station, which has been continuously occupied since 2000 by spacefliers who spend tours of duty generally lasting four to six months. The current plan calls for the space station to be maintained through 2020, although the United States and the 14 other countries supporting the $100 billion-plus station project are already considering extending its operating life.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A pump on one of the station's two external cooling loops shut down after hitting a temperature limit, NASA said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Teams worked to get the cooling loop back up and running, NASA said. Experts suspect a malfunctioning valve may have caused the problem, but they're still trying to figure out how to fix it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The station and crew aboard were never in any danger, NASA said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials could determine that an emergency spacewalk is the best way to fix the failed pump -- something they've done in the past. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASA said Thursday that there has been no decision on the spacewalk, and it may be a couple of days before the decision is made, according to Kenny Todd, the ISS mission management team chairman.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nPhoto by James Nielsen/AFP/Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ten years ago this morning, National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks faced a dilemma. As the forecast coordinator that day for the Slidell, Louisiana, office—which has responsibility for New Orleans—he needed to find a way to convey the urgency and seriousness of the situation his region would face the next day as Hurricane Katrina made landfall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is what he came up with: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR National Weather Service NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These bold words, considered by many to be the most dire—and effective—weather forecast ever issued by the National Weather Service, are now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, along with a rosary from Ricks’ grandmother he held as he and his fellow forecasters rode out the storm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a conference of broadcast meteorologists earlier this year, Ricks said, “On that particular fateful day, when I issued that product … I was awestruck.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another, less widely circulated official forecast he issued that day, the Area Forecast Discussion, was more to the point: “Godspeed to all those in the path of this storm.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bold statements like Ricks’ have been occasionally used—and officially encouraged—in recent years by the National Weather Service, as part of an effort to increase the effectiveness of sometimes bland government bulletins during true weather emergencies. Most notably, meteorologist Gary Szatkowski’s “personal plea” during Hurricane Sandy’s New York City-area landfall in 2012—which included gut-wrenching statements like “if you are still reluctant (to evacuate), think about your loved ones”—earned him hero status.\nPassage 2:\nNEW ORLEANS — On Aug. 28, the storm was still a day away. Evacuations were under way and people were just starting to arrive at the Superdome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At his desk at the National Weather Service office in Slidell, outside New Orleans, meteorologist Robert Ricks knew he had a job to do. He knew he probably had one remaining chance. And so, using computers, history and his fellow forecasters, he sat down to write. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I happened to be on the shift,\" Ricks says. \"I happened to pull the trigger. It just happened to be me that day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the newswires — at NBC News headquarters in New York and across the country — came a document, titled: \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE.\" It was an extraordinary bulletin. It warned of a most powerful hurricane with unprecedented strength. It predicted: \"MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS. PERHAPS LONGER. AT LEAST ONE HALF OF WELL-CONSTRUCTED HOMES WILL HAVE ROOF AND WALL FAILURE. ALL GABLED ROOFS WILL FAIL. THE VAST MAJORITY OF NATIVE TREES WILL BE SNAPPED OR UPROOTED. OTHERS WILL BE TOTALLY DEFOLIATED.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps most remarkably, Ricks' document predicted: \"WATER SHORTAGES WILL MAKE HUMAN SUFFERING INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was the day before the storm. The images of devastation make it clear what happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brian Williams: Did a part of you want to be wrong? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robert Ricks: I would much rather have been wrong in this one. I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf. But our local expertise said otherwise. You know, \"Hey, let's gear up for the big one, this is going to be the big one.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams: How much of you is in that statement? What of you is in that wording? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ricks: I also had to validate each one of those statements and I was, in my mind, I was saying, \"I'm not going to take this out, it sounds valid. I'm not going to take this part out, it sounds valid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams: So you went through point by point? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ricks: Yeah, I read each one. I was trying to find things to actually take out. And I said, \"I cannot find it in myself to take these out, because they seem very valid for the situation.\" And I came from the experience of going through Betsy and Camille myself in the Lower Ninth Ward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But his document was right. And now this lifelong resident of New Orleans, who grew up in the hard-hit Lower Ninth Ward section of the city, is back at work alongside co-workers who have no homes and are wearing the clothes they wore that day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams: If you knew the damage was going to be like this, you did everything in your power to tell people a monster was coming, did the response break your heart? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ricks: Yes, it did. Because we always prepare for the big one; we just didn't think it was going to come this soon.\n", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day. That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Internet trolls bullied Robin Williams' daughter off of Twitter and Instagram just days after her father's death. A handful of Twitter users sent Zelda Williams messages on Twitter that blamed her for Robin Williams' suicide by hanging, as well as pictures of the comedian altered to show bruises around his neck. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As my Washington Post colleague Caitlin Dewey reported, Zelda Williams, 25, said she could not bear the messages and would stay off of Twitter and Instagram for a \"good long time.\" She also asked her social network followers to petition the company to block two particular accounts that were responsible for the bulk of the abuse. Those accounts have since been removed by Twitter. In a statement, the company said that it will be updating its policies in light of the incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We will not tolerate abuse of this nature on Twitter,\" Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, said in a statement. \"We have suspended a number of accounts related to this issue for violating our rules and we are in the process of evaluating how we can further improve our policies to better handle tragic situations like this one. This includes expanding our policies regarding self-harm and private information, and improving support for family members of deceased users.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the messages that forced Zelda Williams offline are just a sliver of the types of abuse many face on Twitter. Imani Gandy, senior legal analyst at the reproductive health publication RH Reality Check, wrote Tuesday about abuse she said she faces on the service every day -- in general and from one man, in particular, whom she has been unable to stop. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is more than a few mean comments, according to her account. She wrote that the abuse leveled at her has been constant because of her race, gender and even her medical condition -- she said she has a brain tumor which this man has accused her of faking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She's ignored him, and taken other steps as well. \"I’ve blocked at least a thousand of his accounts over the past two years,\" she wrote. \"I’ve reported him using Twitter’s 'Report Abuse' form. I briefly considered calling the police, but, really, what would be the point? I’ve seen how police treat stalking victims and victims of online harassment far more severe than mine.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gandy has also collected other instances of harassment similar to hers. In one case, she said, Twitter reviewed a tweet threatening to rape a woman and decided it did not violate its community rules against \"abusive behavior.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Got that?\" Gandy wrote. \"It is not a violation of Twitter’s rules to threaten to rape another Twitter user.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twitter does have a system that lets users report abuse, document harassment and -- in some cases -- get bad accounts taken down. The company also last year introduced a \"Report Abuse\" button, after Caroline Criado-Perez, a British woman leading a campaign to put Jane Austen's image on the 10-pound note, was subjected to a flood of abuse. She said she faced at least one rape threat per minute. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As even Twitter's own statement on Wednesday indicates, many still find its tools don't address the problem. For example, Twitter allows users to block accounts that target them. But sadly, these measures don't even begin to stop persistent attackers, who often create new accounts to continue their actions almost without pause. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While I am truly sorry for what the Williams family is experiencing during this time, I am concerned that it takes an event like this to bring heightened attention to a problem that so many face every day,\" said Soraya Chemaly, a media critic and feminist activist who has worked with Facebook to make more robust protections for those targeted by abuse online. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gandy, in her post, recommends that Twitter take a leaf from a third-party software called \"Block Together.\" The program, which is free for download, lets users automatically block the accounts of new Twitter users who send them direct \"@\" replies, and share their list of blocked accounts with friends. It was created by Electronic Frontier Foundation technologist Jacob Hoffman-Andrews after he read a blog post by iOS developer Danilo Campos calling on Twitter to add many of those features. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chemaly said that Twitter's fierce commitment to free expression may be clouding its judgment on this issue. That attitude is \"all well and good, except it seems to strongly suggest that they don't fundamentally care about the effects of harassment on certain members of their customer base - namely, the ones most likely to need additional protections built into the system,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But if Twitter doesn't take steps to protect the character of its community, Chemaly added, everyone loses. \"As is often the case, it is Williams, the target of abuse, and not her abusers, who's left Twitter,\" she said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mel Greig and Michael Christian from Sydney station 2Day FM have been in hiding and undergoing counselling since their hoax sparked global outrage following the apparent suicide of Jacintha Saldanha. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In interviews on Australian television, the pair broke their silence following Saldanha's death last week in London, as 2Day FM's owner said it was cancelling their show and stopping all hoax calls by its broadcasters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An emotional Greig said she was devastated on hearing the Indian-born nurse had died. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Unfortunately I remember that moment very well because I haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened,\" she told Australia's Seven Network. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"And I remember my first question was, was she a mother?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a separate interview with the Nine Network, Greig added: \"It came into my head that I just wanted to reach out to them (the family), give them a big hug and say sorry.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saldanha was subsequently found dead, although British police have refused to confirm whether it was suicide pending an inquest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Christian said he too was devastated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Shattered, gutted, heartbroken and obviously you know... our deepest sympathies are with the family and the friends,\" he told Nine.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rhys Holleran, chief executive of Southern Cross Austereo, which owns 2Day FM, said the station called the hospital five times to discuss what it had recorded before going to air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he was satisfied that the appropriate checks were conducted before the pre-recorded segment was broadcast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We attempted to contact them on no less than five occasions,\" Holleran told Fairfax radio. \"We wanted to speak to them about it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holleran did not say whether the broadcaster received any response. The stunt was vetted by lawyers before being aired in Sydney last week, according to the station. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a hospital spokesman said: \"Following the hoax call, the station did not talk to anyone in hospital senior management or anyone at the company that handles our media inquiries.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement to the stock exchange, Southern Cross, which has media interests throughout Australia, said that it had decided to halt all prank calls by its broadcasters.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our deepest sympathies go out to the family,\" said Michael Christian. \"We just hope that her family and friends are being as good as they can be and are giving [them] the love and support they need. We are shattered.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two DJs were speaking for the first time since they went into hiding on Saturday when news broke of the the death. They gave interviews to both Channel Nine and Channel Seven's main evening current affairs programmes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked by Channel 9 whose idea the prank call was, the DJs said it had come up at a team meeting before the show, but did not say who suggested it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We had the idea for a simple harmless call. A call that would go for 30 seconds that we thought we would be hung up on,\" said Christian. Neither expected their call to be put through to the Duchess of Cambridge's room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Christian and Greig said they thought the joke was on them and their poor accents rather than on the nurses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Every other media outlet wanted to touch on it. Our angle was having those silly accents,\" said Grieg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They reiterated that no one could have expected or foreseen what happened after the call. \"At every single point it was innocent on our behalf. It was something that was funny and lighthearted and a tragic turn of events that I don't think could have predicted,\" said Christian. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both DJs said they had not participated in the vetting of the interview. They said it was standard practice for them to record an item then hand it over to be assessed by others. Both said they did not know what the vetting process included. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The segment was subject to an internal review, including with 2Day FM's lawyers, before it went to air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The DJs pulled out of a third interview they were scheduled to do for The Project, on the Ten network, because they were unwell, according to a spokesman for the TV channel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The host of the Nine programme, Tracey Grimshaw, earlier tweeted that the interview had not been paid for. It was \"neither asked nor offered\", she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Grimshaw told Fairfax Media the prerecorded interview was \"very intense\" with a lot of people in the room including radio station staff and supporters. She said she felt sympathy for the DJs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They're at a certain point on the food chain. There are other people who made the decision to put it to air. It wasn't live to air. There was a decision made after that prank call was recorded to put it to air, and virtually all the focus has been on them,\" Grimshaw said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rhys Holleran, CEO of Southern Cross Austereo, which owns 2Day FM, said the station attempted to contact King Edward VII hospital \"no less than five times\" before broadcasting the pre-recorded material. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is absolutely true to say that we actually did attempt to contact those people on multiple occasions,\" Holleran told Fairfax Media. \"We rang them to discuss what we had recorded,\" he said, adding that this was done before the recorded prank went to air. \"Absolutely. We attempted to contact them on no less than five occasions. We wanted to speak to them about it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holleran reiterated that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the tragic events that had unfolded since the call but again said no one could have reasonably foreseen the circumstances. He said the station was happy to co-operate with any investigation into the incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement, the radio station's owner, Southern Cross Austero Media, said it had suspended advertising on 2Day FM until further notice, ended Greig and Christian's Hot 30 show and suspended prank calls across the company. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The company does not consider that the broadcast of the segment has breached any relevant law, regulation or code. The company will fully co-operate with any investigations,\" the statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The industry-drawn-up Commercial Radio Codes of Practice and Guidelines state that a station must not broadcast the words of an identifiable person unless they have been informed in advance that the recording may go to air. If someone is unaware they are being recorded, the interviewee must grant consent for it to be played, prior to anything being broadcast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is not the first time the radio station 2Day FM has been in trouble. It has had two licence conditions imposed on it in the past three years by the statutory regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first followed an on-air incident in 2009 in which a 14-year-old girl was strapped to a lie detector, and was questioned by her mother about whether she was sexually active. The mother volunteered to quiz her daughter despite apparently already knowing she had been sexually assaulted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When she said that she had been raped at age 12, 2Day FM's 'shock jock', Kyle Sandilands, who presented the show with DJ Jackie O'Neil, then asked: \"Right, and is that the only sexual experience you've had?\" The interview ended after O'Neil stepped in and she and Sandilands apologised. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ACMA found that the station had breached standards of decency and ordered the it to implement staff training programmes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2012 another licence condition was imposed after Sandilands insulted a female journalist for reporting the low ratings of a TV show that he and O'Neil had presented.

Clark feels that it might be hard for his siblings to deal with the loss of their brother because of how young they are.

Seismological data indicated the weapon was the most powerful ever detonated by the rogue nation, nuclear experts said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR North Korean state media claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear weapon, which could be fitted atop a long-range missile capable of striking the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lawmaker Kim Byung-kee told reporters Monday after the same briefing that the NIS said North Korea may test-fire an ICBM towards the North Pacific at a lower angle than the two tests in July, which were lofted, meaning they flew higher but not as far.

The suspect was found crossing a river, and officers pursued her in \"water that was up to their chin.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She was threatening harm to several witnesses, leading them to believe she was armed, Salazar said. Deputies later found the female suspect on a porch, after she had broken into a house. She has several felony warrants in her name, Salazar said.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nMore from this journal\nPassage 2:\nColorectal cancer is often considered a disease that affects primarily older men, yet this perception may be changing. An extensive analysis of recent data showed that one in every seven colorectal cancer patients was younger than 50. The University of Michigan study raises questions about the current guidelines to begin screening at age 50. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Signs of colorectal cancer, often called the “symptomless cancer,” include anemia, a dramatic change in the size or frequency of bowel movements, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool, (sometimes appearing as black threads), in bowel movements. Because these symptoms may be nonexistent, mild, or infrequent, many people are not aware of their condition until their malignancy becomes advanced and spreads into the lymph nodes. A colonoscopy is the usual screening test, but stool tests are also effective for some people. If you are worried, you can request your primary care physician provide you with one of these simple stool tests, no matter your age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Younger Patients Increasing NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seeing a recent rise in cancer cases among younger people, a team led by Dr. Samantha Hendren conducted a study of the nationally representative Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Insitute to assess age and treatment patterns among colorectal patients. Specifically, they gathered and analyzed data from patients diagnosed in the United States between 1998 and 2011. Their results point to important changes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of more than 258,000 total colorectal cancer patients, 37,847 (about 15 percent) were younger than 50. These younger-than-expected patients were more likely to be diagnosed with either regional or distant malignancies, both of which are more dangerous than localized tumors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In terms of treatment, younger patients suffering with a distant metastasis — where the cancer has spread from an original tumor — were more likely to undergo surgery than older patients; 72 percent versus 63 percent. Radiation therapy was more likely to be used with younger rectal cancer patients than in older patients; 53 percent versus 48 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By various measures, younger patients saw more positive results. Despite the tendency to have more advanced disease when diagnosed, younger-than-50 colorectal cancer patients overall lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. With regard to localized disease, the five-year survival rate was 95.1 percent for younger patients versus 91.9 percent for older patients, with regard to regional disease, 76 percent versus 70.3 percent, and with regard to distant disease 21.3 percent versus 14.1 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These findings suggest the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults,” wrote the researchers in the study. They believe their work is a wake-up call to the medical community, which should be looking for the signs of colorectal cancer in patients younger than 50. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If age 50 is maintained as the recommended time to begin screening, this study suggests that nearly 15 percent of all patients may be caught late in the process of disease. By comparison, breast cancer screening is recommended to begin at age 40. Less than 5 percent of invasive breast cancers occur in women under that age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Source: Abdelsattar Z, Wong S, Regenbogen S, et al. Colorectal Cancer Outcomes and Treatment Patterns in Patients Too Young for Average-Risk Screening. CANCER. 2016.\nPassage 3:\n(Reuters Health) - One in seven colon and rectal cancers in the U.S. are now diagnosed in patients younger than age 50, which is when people are advised to begin routine screenings for these tumors, a new study finds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50, researchers estimate in the journal Cancer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Colorectal cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly; this study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colorectal cancers are occurring in young people,” said senior study author Dr. Samantha Hendren of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers analyzed cancer registry data from 1998 to 2011 for about 258,000 patients with colorectal tumors and found that 37,847 of them, or almost 15 percent, were diagnosed before age 50. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Compared with older patients, those under 50 were 30 percent more likely to be diagnosed with tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes and 50 percent more likely to have cancer that had advanced to other organs, the study found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Younger patients with tumors that had metastasized, or reached other organs, were also more likely than older people to get more aggressive treatments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 72 percent of people under 50 got surgery, compared with 63 percent of older individuals. And while 53 percent of younger patients received radiation, just 48 percent of older people did. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even though patients diagnosed younger tended to have more aggressive disease, they also lived slightly longer without tumors returning after their initial course of treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Five-year survival odds were about 95 percent for patients under 50 diagnosed with local tumors that hadn’t spread yet, compared to roughly 92 percent for older people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With tumors that spread to the lymph nodes, five-year survival rates were 76 percent for young people and 70 percent for older patients, while with cancers that metastasized to other organs the survival odds were 21 percent versus 14 percent, respectively. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One shortcoming of the study is that researchers lacked data on family history and other risk factors for colorectal cancers, the authors note. It’s also possible that treatment choices and overall survival were influenced by what’s known as selection bias, when healthier people may get more interventions and have better outcomes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Often, patients may get an early warning of colorectal tumors with symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel habits or pain when going to the bathroom that can point to the need for diagnostic screening, said Dr. Joel Randolph Hecht, director of the gastrointestinal oncology program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,” Hecht, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are guidelines for screening some people starting at age 40 if they have a family history of colorectal cancer, noted Dr. Sidney Winawer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Without a family history, physicians need to use their judgment when seeing young people who have bowel symptoms and refer those of concern to a gastroenterologist for a diagnostic workup, “ Winawer, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email. “This is difficult since we do not wish to expose young people to unnecessary tests.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It isn’t clear from the study findings, however, whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths, said Dr. David Weinberg, chairman of medicine at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If the goal of screening is disease prevention, as it generally is for colorectal cancer, it is not clear when screening should start,” Weinberg, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Too early and the yield of screening will be very low since young people are still less likely to get colorectal cancer than older people.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SOURCE: bit.ly/23o5QvC Cancer, online January 25, 2016.\nPassage 4:\nMONDAY, Jan. 25, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Colon cancer rates are rising among men and women under 50, the age at which guidelines recommend screenings start, a new analysis shows. One in seven colon cancer patients is under 50. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively, the researchers reported. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" said study lead author Dr. Samantha Hendren, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50,\" she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Hendren said it's too soon to say whether colon cancer screening guidelines should be altered to reflect that trend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the analysis, colon cancer among younger patients was often found at an advanced stage, meaning the disease has spread to lymph nodes or other organs. \"Part of the reason for this is that these young patients are often diagnosed only after their cancers start to cause symptoms, such as anemia, bowel bleeding or a blockage in the colon,\" Hendren explained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doctors should be on the lookout for these warning signs of colon cancer, she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not all bowel bleeding is caused by cancer, she said. \"Bright red bleeding with a bowel movement is usually due to hemorrhoids or fissures, but dark blood or blood mixed with the stool is a warning sign,\" Hendren said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People with a family history of colon cancer and others who are at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50, she said. \"This is already recommended, but we don't think this is happening consistently, and this is something we need to optimize,\" she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report was published online Jan. 25 in the journal Cancer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults isn't known. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is unexplained,\" he said. \"It's not simply a change in diagnoses, it's a very real increase. There may be an effect of our environment that could be contributing to the increase.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smoking, obesity and physical inactivity are all risk factors for colon cancer, as is a poor diet, Chan said. \"When we are faced with patients who have many of these elements, we should think more about the potential of them developing colon cancer at an earlier age,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the study, Hendren and her colleagues culled federal government data on nearly 260,000 patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1998 and 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of these patients, nearly 15 percent were younger than 50. These patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer and more likely to have surgery than older patients (72 percent versus 63 percent). Radiation therapy was also used more often in younger patients than in older patients (53 percent versus 48 percent), the researchers found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Younger patients lived a little longer without a cancer recurrence, even though they tended to have more advanced cancer, Hendren said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For patients under 50, about 68 percent survived five years, while about 67 percent of the patients 50 and older survived five years, she said. \"It looks like patients' young age helps them in their cancer treatment and survival,\" she added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These findings raise the question of whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age, Hendren said. \"This would be a big and costly change, and I don't know whether it would help more people than it would hurt, so a lot of research would be required to understand this before any changes should be made,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chan noted that although the incidence of colon cancer is increasing among people under 50, the risk is still low. \"I don't think the data at this point support expanding screening to younger age groups,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hendren said that \"the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More information NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute for more on colon cancer.\n", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nA chance discovery at a rock shelter in southern Australia has revealed a human settlement dating back 49,000 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Archaeologist Giles Hamm was surveying the territory in Flinders Ranges with aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard when his colleague needed a toilet break. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nature called and Cliff walked up this creek bed into this gorge and found this amazing spring surrounded by rock art,\" Mr Hamm told ABC news. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image: The finding is crucial in understanding human settlement in Australia. Pic Giles Hamm NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What sparked the archaeologists' interest was a rock shelter with a blackened roof because, Mr Hamm told ABC, \"that's people lighting fires inside that rock shelter, that's human activity\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sophisticated tools and bone fragments from the largest ever marsupial were found at the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eventually some 4,300 objects and 200 bone fragments were recovered. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists working with Mr Hamm's team have determined the age of the site at 49,000 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aboriginal Australians are the oldest continued civilisation in the world, descending from the first people to leave Africa, according to a genetic study published by the University of Copenhagen in September. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image: Scientists determined the age of the site at 49,000 years. Pic Giles Hamm NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the time of arrival of the first Australians is debated among researchers. The consensus view is they arrived 50,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mr Hamm said their presence 49,000 years ago at a site in southern Australia suggested they must have reached northern parts far earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If people did come 50,000 years ago, it doesn't give them much time to move so far south,\" Mr Hamm said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There could have been colonisation much earlier than the accepted time frame of 50,000 years ago. It could be 55,000 maybe 60,000 years ago.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image: Flinders Ranges is 550km north of Adelaide. Pic Giles Hamm NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The site also contained evidence of human interaction with mega fauna, namely the Diprotodon optatum - a marsupial measuring 2m in height and weighing more than 2,500kg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists have previously puzzled over how humans had interacted with them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the presence of bones from juvenile animals in a cave on a cliff suggests they were hunted, said Gavin Prideaux, palaeontologist at Flinders University in South Australia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Those animals weren't built to climb up a cliff into the settlement, the only way they could have got there was through human agency,\" he said.\nPassage 2:\nExcavation methods NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hand excavation was undertaken within Warratyi rock shelter (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c), using two 2 × 1 m trenches (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c). The first exploratory trench (squares 4C and 4D) was located on the southern side of the shelter to provide a cross-section through potential living areas from east to west (taking in part of the back wall). The second trench (squares 2B and 2C) was positioned in the centre of the shelter floor. Square 2B was only excavated down to spit 6 (30 cm) until obstructed by a large roof fall block. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Excavation was carried out using a 1-m grid system. This grid was further subdivided into 25 cm square units (quadrats: A–D Extended Data Fig. 1c) to enable greater recording precision. Excavation was undertaken using 5 cm spits, with a trowel and hand shovel and the excavated material was dry-sieved through (8, 5 and 2 mm) sieves. Stratigraphic features, such as charcoal lenses, ash or hearth-like lenses, were all drawn, photographed and noted during the excavation process. Detailed profile drawings were made on completion of the excavation. If possible, stone artefacts, bone and ochre were individually recorded and excavated from their in situ location and bagged separately, rather than being retrieved from the bulk sediment collected from individual spits. To reduce the potential for contamination of the excavated surfaces by loose material falling into the pit, the area surrounding each square (where possible) was covered with plastic sheeting and any loose spoil removed. Excavators were encouraged to wear soft shoes to reduce potential damage to the pit walls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each spit was recorded using a standard excavation sheet, which included making notes of the individual features and conditions encountered within each square and quadrat. A geomorphologist (P.M.) was present during the excavation process to advise excavators on the variability of sedimentary units and the positions of potential depositional changes associated with strata boundaries. When these depositional changes were detected during the excavation, they were noted and new strata were excavated as separate entities within a spit. This process reduced the potential for the sediment of two different strata being mixed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Where a filled burrow (mostly attributable to rabbits) was encountered, the infilling sediment was removed as a discrete unit and bagged separately. These burrows were excavated in each square before the undisturbed enclosing sediments were excavated, thereby minimising potential contamination of the primary sediment by younger and/or mixed burrow infill material. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All in situ finds larger than 2 cm (including bone) were plotted in plan view within each excavated quadrat (A–D) and their depth ascertained by levelling within each spit (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c). Some of these in situ finds were photographed, however, most were not as their importance at the time of the excavation was not known (for example, bone point and Diprotodon bone fragments). All sediment removed from each spit was weighed. All material remaining on the sieves was bagged for further analysis. Bulk soil samples were removed for sedimentary analyses. At a later stage, sediment residues were wet-sieved through a 1-mm mesh before sorting. All charcoal, artefacts, bone fragments and plant matter recovered from this process were bagged. The location of charcoal samples collected during the excavation was plotted on plans, their depth recorded and then bagged separately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A total of 1,070 stone artefacts were tested for refitting from square 2C in order to confirm the integrity of the apparently intact depositional laminae. These artefacts were assessed to see if they could be refitted together as parts of a former piece of stone artefact, on the assumption that their original separation was attributable to stone reduction activity and that they must have originated on a single surface in the shelter. All artefacts from square 2C that were greater than 10 mm in maximum dimension were assessed for refitting. Each refit set comprised artefacts that could be treated analytically as a single knapping episode30. As such, the distance between artefact elevations for each refitting set provides a proxy measure for the vertical displacement of cultural material through the deposit by human trampling and other post-depositional activty31. Refitting was attempted within a 1 × 1 m area, which represents only a sample of the occupied area and therefore is unlikely to capture an entire knapping event. In addition, artefacts will have undoubtedly been laterally dispersed as a result of repeated human and animal occupation; therefore we can predict that the overall percentage of refits (the ‘success rate’) will be low32. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Optical dating of quartz grains NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seven optical dating samples were collected from cleaned exposures of excavation square 2C using metal tubes, and wrapped in light-proof bags for transportation and storage. Bulk sediment samples were also collected from the surrounding few centimetres of each sample tube for β-dose rate determination and water content analysis. In the laboratory, quartz grains of 180–212 μm diameter were extracted from the un-illuminated centres of the metal tubes under safe light (dim red LED) conditions and prepared for burial dose estimation using standard procedures33, including etching by 48% hydrofluoric acid for 40 min to remove the α-irradiated external layers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two semi-independent approaches were used to obtain optical age estimates for the Warratyi samples. Single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of quartz34, 35 was routinely applied to all samples, and was preferred over standard multiple-grain OSL dating because of its ability to identify insufficiently bleached grain populations36, 37, contaminant grains associated with post-depositional mixing38, and aberrant grains displaying inherently unsuitable luminescence properties39, 40. Single-grain TT-OSL dating of quartz41, 42, 43 was applied to the oldest sample in the sequence (ERS-7) as a means of cross-checking the reliability of the OSL-dating approach over dose ranges of 150–200 Gy. TT-OSL dating was applied to individual grains of quartz rather than multi-grain aliquots in this study, following the reliable application of this approach at other archaeological cave and rock shelter sites38, 44, 45. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR OSL and TT-OSL equivalent dose (D e ) measurements were made using experimental apparatus and quality assurance criteria described previously38, 44. Samples were irradiated with a Risø TL-DA-20 90Sr/90Y β source that had been calibrated to administer known doses to multi-grain aliquots and single-grain discs. For single-grain measurements, spatial variations in the β-dose rate across the disc plane were taken into account by undertaking hole-specific calibrations using γ-irradiated quartz. Quartz grains with a diameter of 180–212 μm were measured in standard single-grain aluminium discs drilled with an array of 300 × 300 μm holes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR D e values were determined for individual grains of quartz using the single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) procedures34 shown in Supplementary Table 3. Between 900 and 1,300 individual quartz grains of each sample were measured for D e determination (Supplementary Table 4). Sensitivity-corrected dose–response curves were constructed using the first 0.17 s of each green-laser stimulation after subtracting a mean background count obtained from the last 0.25 s of the signal. A preheat of 260 °C for 10 s was used in the OSL SAR procedure before measuring the natural (L n ) and regenerative dose (L x ) signals, and a cut-heat of 160 °C was applied before undertaking the test-dose OSL measurements (T n and T x ) (Supplementary Table 3). These preheating conditions yielded an accurate measured-to-recovered dose ratio of 1.03 ± 0.03 and a relatively low overdispersion value of 12 ± 3% for a ~130 Gy dose-recovery test performed on individual grains of sample ERS-5 (Extended Data Fig. 6A). The single-grain TT-OSL SAR procedure (Supplementary Table 3) uses a TT-OSL test dose measurement rather than an OSL test-dose measurement (step 11) to correct for sensitivity change, following suitability assessments performed elsewhere40, 44, 45, 46. A dose-recovery test performed on 1,200 individual quartz grains of sample ERS-7 attests to the general suitability of this SAR procedure (Extended Data Fig 6A). The TT-OSL dose-recovery test was performed on a batch of unbleached grains owing to the relatively long periods of light exposure needed to bleach natural TT-OSL signals down to low residual levels47. A known (172 Gy) laboratory dose of similar magnitude to the expected D e was added on top of the natural signals for these grains. The recovered dose was then calculated by subtracting the weighted mean natural D e of sample ERS-7 (168 ± 12 Gy; determined on a separate batch of grains and summarized in Supplementary Table 5) from the weighted mean D e of these unbleached and dosed grains (350 ± 18 Gy). This approach yielded a net (that is, natural-subtracted) recovered-to-given ratio of 1.06 ± 0.09 for sample ESR-7. An overdispersion value of 12 ± 9% was calculated for the D e distribution of the unbleached and dosed batch of grains, which is consistent with that obtained for the single-grain OSL dose-recovery test. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Individual D e estimates are presented with their 1 standard error ranges (Supplementary Table 5 and Extended Data Fig. 6C), which have been derived from three sources of uncertainty: (i) a random uncertainty term arising from photon-counting statistics for each OSL or TT-OSL measurement, calculated using equation 3 from ref. 48; (ii) an empirically determined instrument-reproducibility uncertainty of 2% for each single-grain measurement; and (iii) a dose–response curve fitting uncertainty determined using 1,000 iterations of the Monte Carlo method implemented in Analyst49. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Environmental dose rates have been calculated using a combination of in situ field γ-ray spectrometry and high-resolution γ spectrometry of dried and homogenized bulk sediments collected directly from the OSL-sampling positions. Cosmic-ray dose-rate contributions were calculated using the equations in ref. 50 after taking into consideration site altitude, geomagnetic latitude, density, thickness and geometry of the sediment or bedrock overburden. A small, assumed internal (α plus β) dose rate of 0.03 ± 0.01 Gy per kyr has been included in the final dose-rate calculations, based on published 238U and 232Th measurements for etched quartz grains from a range of locations51, 52, 53, 54 and an α efficiency factor (a value) of 0.04 ± 0.01 (refs 55, 56, 57). Radionuclide concentrations and specific activities have been converted to dose rates using published conversion factors58, allowing for β-dose attenuation59, 60 where applicable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Radiocarbon (14C) dating of hearth charcoal and eggshell samples NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seventeen eggshell fragments (15 Dromaius, 2 megapode) and two large charcoal fragments associated with hearth features were used to derive the final 14C chronology of SU1A to SU4. A range of other organic materials were initially submitted for 14C analysis but these were considered unreliable based on stratigraphic or methodological grounds, as detailed in Supplementary Information (radiocarbon dating). Samples were pretreated using acid–base–acid procedures and their 14C contents were measured using accelerator mass spectrometry at the Waikato Radiocarbon Laboratory and the ANSTO Radiocarbon Facility. Uncalibrated eggshell and charcoal 14C ages (Supplementary Table 7) are expressed in 14C years before present (14C yr bp, where bp is defined as 1950 ad) following standard reporting conventions61. Isotopic fractionation has been corrected for by using the measured δ13C value of each sample. The 14C age estimates have been calibrated with the internationally ratified southern hemisphere SHCal13 curve62, using OxCal v4.2.4 (ref. 63). The calibrated 14C age ranges (cal yr bp) are described as 95.4% probability ranges throughout. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bayesian age modelling NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bayesian age modelling was used to integrate all stratigraphically reliable chronological information within a unified statistical framework and to derive combined age estimates for individual stratigraphic units. The Bayesian age model for Warratyi was constructed using OxCal v4.2.4 (ref. 63). A sequence-deposition model with nested phases of uniform prior duration and associated boundaries was used to derive a combined chronostratigraphic framework for the site, following the approach outlined previously64. The main depositional sequence incorporates the five stratigraphic units found at Warratyi (SU1A–SU4) in an ordered succession according to depth. Units have been represented as nested sequences within the broader depositional column as their overall stratigraphic ordering is sufficiently well preserved. Separate phases have been used to represent groupings of numerical ages within individual units. This approach was deemed necessary for SU2–SU4 because the 14C and optical dating samples were collected from multiple excavation squares that exhibited potentially irregular or spatially heterogeneous stratigraphic relationships. The exact relative ordering of dating samples from each unit could therefore not be directly constrained in a vertical profile. SU1A and SU1B are internally heterogeneous and exhibit signs of inter-horizon mixing, as borne out by the multiple dose components of optical dating samples ERS-1, ERS-2 and ERS-3 (see Supplementary Information: chronology). This has prevented us from making any assumptions about relative chronological ordering of dated horizons within these units, although the relative ordering of SU1A and SU1B remains sufficiently clear. Groupings within SU1A and SU1B were therefore also nested as separate phases rather than sub-sequences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Each stratigraphic unit has been represented by a single phase, with the exception of SU3. This unit is significantly thicker than the others at Warratyi and can be differentiated into two broad archaeo–palaeontological phases according to distinct changes in artefact content and bone abundance at a depth of approximately 60–65 cm (Fig. 2). Two separate phases were nested within the SU3 sequence to account for archaeological sub-structuring of the dated horizons. Boundaries were used to delineate the beginning and end of each stratigraphic unit. We have not, however, incorporated any prior depositional gaps in the sequence model as there is no direct evidence of unconformities at Warratyi. The entire site sequence has been constrained with a minimum age of 0 years before 1950 ad and a maximum age of 60 kyr before 1950 ad. The latter represents a conservative upper age estimate for this archaeological sequence and has been chosen to predate sufficiently the earliest existing evidence of human presence in Australia around ≤50 ka, as determined from an assessment of 26 early occupation sites across Sahul65. We note, however, that the Bayesian age model is largely insensitive to our choice of maximum age constraint given the range of likelihoods obtained on the lowest stratigraphic unit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 14C data were input into the model as conventional ages (using the OxCal R_Date function) and were subsequently calibrated using the SHCal13 curve62 as part of the modelling procedure. Modelled posterior 14C age ranges are therefore presented in calendar years before 1950 ad (cal yr bp). To avoid introducing systematic errors in the posterior results, optical dating ages (calculated as kyr before sample collection in 2012 ad) were similarly converted to years before 1950 ad before their incorporation in the model. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The final Bayesian age model for Warratyi was run using the general outlier function66, which is based on a Student’s t-test distribution with 5 degrees of freedom. Prior outlier probabilities of 5% were equally assigned to all dating samples to identify potentially significant statistical outliers. Likelihood estimates that yielded posterior outlier probabilities >5% were not excluded from the final model but were proportionally down-weighted in the iterative Monte Carlo runs, thereby producing an averaged chronological model66. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Use-wear and residue analyses NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Use-wear studies were conducted using a hand-held polarizing Dino-Lite AM4815ZT microscope at magnifications of 30× to 230×. Additional high-power microscopic investigation using an Olympus BX51 at magnifications of 50× and 500× in brightfield and darkfield, were undertaken on seven artefacts. Within the overall study, six small samples of residue (approximately 10–20 μl) were extracted from margins or areas of interest on specific stone artefacts. Samples were extracted with pipettes using distilled water as the lifting medium and transferred to slides that had been pre-cleaned with ethanol. The Dino-lite was used to guide this process. Sample slides were dried under covers for 24 h and then stained with a 0.25% solution of picrosirius red using the protocols described previously67. A Leitz Dialux 22 microscope with polarizing capability was used to examine the stained slides. Residues were photographed in plane, part-polarized and cross-polarized light at a magnification of 400× using a Tucsen ISH 500 camera.

Fossils and archaeological material generated in this study will be deposited at the SA Museum and an Adnyamathanha Traditional Lands Association (ATLA)-keeping place within a 6–12-month time-frame and will be publicly accessible upon request with permission from ATLA and the corresponding author.\nPassage 3:\nOldest known evidence of Aboriginal settlement in arid Australia found in Flinders Ranges rock shelter NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Updated NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The chance discovery of a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges has unearthed one of the most important prehistoric sites in Australia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Key points: Dating of artefacts and fossils from Warratyi indicates human settlement between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Timing shows people moved through central Australia and used key technologies such as stone axes and ochre much earlier than previously thought NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Archaeological evidence also shows humans lived alongside, and hunted megafauna NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The site, known as Warratyi, shows Aboriginal Australians settled the arid interior of the country around 49,000 years ago — some 10,000 years earlier than previously thought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shelter, about 550 kilometres north of Adelaide, also contains the first reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Artefacts excavated at the site also push back the earliest-known dates on the development of key bone and stone axe technologies and the use of ochre in Australia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lead author Giles Hamm, a consultant archaeologist and doctoral student at La Trobe University, found the site with local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard while surveying gorges in the northern Flinders Ranges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nature called and Cliff walked up this creek bed into this gorge and found this amazing spring surrounded by rock art,\" Mr Hamm said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Hamm said during a survey of the gorge they noticed a rock shelter with a blackened roof about 20 metres above the creek bed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Immediately when we saw that we thought, 'Wow, that's people lighting fires inside that rock shelter, that's human activity',\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At the time they had no idea how significant the find was, Mr Hamm admitted, and thought maybe it would reach back about 5,000 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Excavations reveal treasure trove of artefacts and bones NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Working with the Adnyamathanha people over the past nine years, Mr Hamm and colleagues recovered from the one-metre-deep excavations around 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Importantly dating of the artefacts and fossil finds show humans occupied the site from 49,000 to 46,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Hamm said the significance of the site was the combination of its age and geographic location. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The previous oldest-known site in the arid zone, located at Puritjarra in western Central Australia, is around 38,000 years old. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"[This discovery] puts people moving south from the northern part of the continent to the southern interior a lot sooner than we thought,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Mr Hamm said it was likely the climate was more favourable when they arrived. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They got there before it became really arid,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In one sense they were trapped in the Flinders Ranges because once the climate changed [due to the last glacial maximum] it was too risky to move out of these well-watered ranges that had these permanent springs.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a view supported by palaeoanthropologist Michael Westaway at Griffith University, who was part of a recent genomic study that confirmed modern Aboriginal Australians are the descendants of the first people to inhabit Australia and showed they adapted genetically to survive in the desert. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our DNA paper suggested the arid centre at 50,000 years ago was not really a barrier to the movement of people, and this seems to be what Giles is suggesting — people were able to migrate south quite quickly,\" Dr Westaway said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the other significant artefact finds at the site was the earliest-known use of ochre in Australia and South-East Asia around 49,000-46,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Hamm said they had pushed back the dates on the development of technologies such as bone needles (40,000-38,000 years ago), wood-handled stone tools (at least 24,000 years ago) and gypsum use (40,000-33,000 years ago). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The site also provided reliably dated evidence of hafted axe technology about 38,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Evidence dates cohabitation with megafauna NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Co-author Professor Gavin Prideaux pointed to the discovery of bones from the extinct giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and eggs from an ancient giant bird as important evidence of interaction with ancient humans which would have an impact on the debate over the extinction of megafauna. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Prideaux, from Flinders University's School of Biological Sciences, said the only previous site in Australia where megafauna remains and human artefacts had been found together was Cuddie Springs in NSW, which had become the subject of controversy over the accuracy of dating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"One good thing about this study ... is there's no doubt there are megafauna remains in the form of Diprotodon and a giant bird in that rock shelter in a well-dated, well-stratified context sometime between 45,000 and 50,000 years ago,\" Professor Prideaux said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The only way those bones and shells got there [because of the steep incline up to the rock shelter] is because people brought them there [to eat] ... in terms of megafauna that's the really significant finding.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Prideaux said the discovery was an important milestone in the debate over whether humans or climate change drove the extinction of megafauna. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"[The find] undermines one of the supposed pillars of support for climate change, not humans, causing the extinctions because [the Warrayti site shows] humans lived alongside these animals and hunted them,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Prideaux said the paper, published yesterday in Nature, \"smashed several paradigms about Indigenous Australians\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"People ... were set up in arid southern Australia by about 50,000 years ago and they had all these amazing technologies much earlier than what we've thought.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Westaway supported this view. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There is a Eurocentric view that material culture in Australia is quite simplistic and backward, but this helps rewrite that story,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elders told stories of shelters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Coulthard, of the Adnyamathanha Traditional Lands Association, said he had worked on the property where Warratyi was located when he was a teenager. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The elders he had worked with had told him their people had lived in the area and had pointed out a lot of the shelters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He had forgotten the information until he teamed up with Mr Hamm and believed \"the spirits showed me the road\" to the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the Adnyamathanha people were proud and happy about the discovery and interested to know how it would be received. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Topics: science-and-technology, indigenous-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander, archaeology, sa NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First posted\nPassage 4:\nHumans arrived in the arid interior of Australia some 10,000 years earlier than we thought, archaeologists suggest, with the discovery of ancient artefacts in a South Australian cave that have been dated to as far back as 49,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That means once humans first set foot on the Australian coastline, it took a mere 1,000 years for them to expand out into its dry interior - further evidence of the ingenuity of what now stands as the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The site, which is a newly discovered cave in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 km north of Adelaide, is known as the Warratyi rock-shelter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Archaeologist Giles Hamm from La Trobe University in Melbourne led the excavations at the cave, finding what appear to be some of the oldest bone and quartz tools ever found in Australia, plus the earliest known use of the pigment ochre in the country’s history. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Artefacts that have been found so far include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre and gypsum pigments, and the team says this is evidence that these early technologies were developed locally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The old idea is that people might have come from the East, from the Levant, out of Africa, and these modern humans may have come with a package of innovative technologies,\" Hamm told Nicola Davis at The Guardian. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"But the development of these fine stone tools, the bone technology, we think that happened as a local innovation, due to a local cultural evolution.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s significant, adds one of the team, Gavin Prideaux from Flinders University in Adelaide, because it challenges certain assumptions that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in on the globe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There is a Eurocentric view that material culture in Australia is quite simplistic and backward, but this helps rewrite that story,\" he told ABC News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until now, the oldest human tool found in Australia’s vast, arid interior has been a tiny axe fragment found earlier this year in the Carpenter's Gap rock-shelter of the Kimberley region of northwest Australia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the Carpenter’s Gap site is not far from the northwest coast of Australia - thought to be one of the earliest settled parts of Australia - the Warratyi rock-shelter sits more than 2,000 km from the early settlement of Lake Mungo in southeasten New South Wales, making it a much more difficult trek. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tools have been dated based on a couple of estimates - quartz grains from the site have been dated to 44,000 years ago, but radiocarbon dating of the burnt eggshells, which are thought to be evidence of human cooking, revealed them to be between 45,000 and 49,000 years old. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shells are thought to have come from emus and a large, extinct flightless bird from the Genyornis genus. Together with discovery of bones of a huge, extinct wombat-like species, Diprotodon optatum, this suggests that early humans were actually interacting with Australia’s legendary megafauna. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Diprotodon reconstruction. Credit: Dmitry Bogdanov/Wikimedia NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This doesn’t necessarily mean they were hunting them, but they were at least living in close enough quarters that they could find bones and eggs and bring them back to the cave. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"One good thing about this study ... is there's no doubt there are megafauna remains in the form of Diprotodon and a giant bird in that rock shelter in a well-dated, well-stratified context sometime between 45,000 and 50,000 years ago,\" Prideaux told the ABC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The only way those bones and shells got there is because people brought them there ... in terms of megafauna that's the really significant finding.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The find is, of course, controversial, because that tiny axe fragment we mentioned earlier has been dated to around the same time period - 44,000 to 49,000 years ago. The problem is these estimates are all fairly rough, and still up for interpretation - Hamm's team, for example, insists that the axe is no more than 48,000 years old. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"[E]veryone is keen to make their site sound older,\" Sue O'Connor from the Australian National University, who was not involved in either find, told Marcus Strom at The Sydney Morning Herald. But she did add that \"the Hamm discovery was likely older\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The methodology of this study is as good as it gets,\" she said. \"It's a very important site and a really significant find.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Debate will likely rage among archaeologists for some time, but the most important thing is that we're finally seeing real evidence of just how widespread the Indigenous Australians were within just 1,000 years of hitting the coast. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study has been published in Nature.\n", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News. Hamm was surveying a section of Australia's Flinders Ranges when his partner, aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard, had to go to the bathroom. \"Nature called and Cliff walked up this creek bed into this gorge and found this amazing spring surrounded by rock art,\" Hamm says. At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nNeil Warner / Splash News Britney Spears' handlers have strong ideas on how radio deejays should go about interviewing her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Britney will grant you three questions, which she may not answer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pop star Britney Spears recently ended a radio blitz promoting her Las Vegas residency, which starts in December, and her handlers are leaving nothing to chance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Harlem Mepham/FilmMagic NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We’ve been told that before leaving for London this week, Spears did a spree of radio spots, with the stations told that their five-minute interviews could discuss only Brit-Brit’s Vegas show, her new single and her “Britney Jean” album. Just in case there were any doubts about the rules, stations are being informed that these orders are “so everyone is clear — no personal questions and no funny business.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Radio insiders say efforts to limit Spears’ opportunities to embarrass herself are doing the complete opposite, even when interviewers stick to the “assigned parameters.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Deejays Roula and Ryan from Houston’s 104.1 KRBE recently had their taped segment pulled when it turned out to be an absolute disaster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We thought we could make something out of the ‘rules’ dictated before the interview, but as we commenced the interview, we quickly realized this was a one-sided conversation,” said Roula. “That is not entertaining to our audience.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spears’ reps argue the info they provided was not a mandate, but rather an aid to make the radio spots move along smoothly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As with all radio tours, the hosts are sent information on the talent and what they are promoting,” said Spears flack Jeff Raymond. “In this case, the label sent information on ‘Work Bitch’ (the single and video, dates, who directed, where shot, etc.), the upcoming eighth album, and her Vegas residency (title, show dates, etc.) so the hosts have correct info when asking her questions.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oops, Spears did it again on a Houston Hot 95.7 phoner. Even when the hosts lavished praise on her music, tour and perfume, a detached-sounding Spears needed to be asked twice if she had a fragrance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The voices in her head are slowing down her conversation,” said a deejay on the air after the Q&A, dismissing Spears’ claims of a bad phone connection. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month, a Vegas insider told us that speaking isn’t the only thing Britney has given up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Britney does not sing. She is being paid a lot of money to lip-sync,” a source told Confidenti@l. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spears has since denied that she’ll lip-sync in Vegas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, before-and-after images emerged from Hoax Films, a visual-effects studio, of the 31-year-old mother of two’s “Work Bitch” video. They suggest that a chubby Spears did the filming, but a digitally slimmed-down version appears in the final edit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Team Britney didn’t comment on the video.

And since a court ruled in 2008 that she was not fit to, her father, Jamie Spears has stepped in. Jamie has overseen Britney’s life pretty much without complaint for more than five years, but now, RadarOnline.com has learned, he’s asking for more money! Court documents obtained by RadarOnline.com expose what Jamie’s been paid for taking care of his daughter, and what his demands are going forward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I continue to perform services to protect and care for Britney’s person and to administer her estate in good faith and in her best interests,” Jamie writes in a new petition that was filed on October 15 in L.A. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He reveals, “I continue to have significant oversight duties relating to her visitation with her children.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR COURT DOCUMENTS: Britney Spears’ Dad To Conservatorship Judge: I Want More Money! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From the beginning, Jamie’s been paid $16,000 per month for those duties, and is now asking the court merely to extend that compensation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he also receives $1,200 per month to pay rent for his office, and now, he claims, that’s not enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He claims, “as my rent has steadily escalated over the last three years, I request that I be reimbursed an additional $800.00 per month for my office expense for the time period of November 1, 2012, through August 31, 2013,” which adds up to $7,200. He also asks “that I be authorized to spend the sum of $2,000 monthly, rather than the previously ordered $1,200 monthly, for my office space in a secure location that is dedicated to Britney’s activities.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PHOTOS: Britney Back In Shape, Shows Off Bikini Bod NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jamie claims he uses that office for completing Brit’s business duties, such as the recently concluded “negotiations with respect to Britney’s upcoming concert series at Planet Hollywood … to maximize the contractual benefits she would receive with a minimum of financial risk to her and a safe, structured, and pleasant environment.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fact, signing on to the show ensured that Britney will remain under her dad’s control for at least two more years, as RadarOnline.com reported, which means Jamie will rake in at least $432,000 more from his daughter’s estate before she has any hope of getting out of the conservatorship.\n", "answers": ["Britney Spears' father, Jamie, has been in charge of her since she was placed under conservatorship in 2008, and he thinks it's about time for a raise, Radar reports. \"I continue to perform services to protect and care for Britney’s person and to administer her estate in good faith and in her best interests.

Israeli attacks in the strip continued Thursday, with witnesses saying... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JERUSALEM (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel will destroy the Hamas tunnel network in the Gaza Strip \"with or without a cease-fire,\" as the military called up another 16,000 reservists to pursue its campaign in the densely-populated territory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Netanyahu's vow came as international efforts to end the 23-day-old conflict seemed to sputter despite concern over the mounting death toll, with more than 1,300 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and more than 50 Israelis, almost all of them soldiers, killed since July 8. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have neutralized dozens of terror tunnels and we are committed to complete this mission, with or without a cease-fire,\" Netanyahu said. \"Therefore I will not agree to any offer that does not allow the military to complete this important mission for the security of the people of Israel.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An initial Israeli aerial campaign against Hamas was widened into a ground offensive on July 17. Since then the campaign has concentrated on destroying more than 30 cross-border tunnels that militants have constructed to carry out attacks on Israeli territory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel says that most of the 32 tunnels it has uncovered have now been demolished and that getting rid of the remainder will take no more than a few days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new reserve call-up follows another day of heavy fighting, in which tank shells struck a U.N. school where Palestinians were sheltering and an airstrike tore through a crowded Gaza shopping area. At least 116 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to discuss the matter with the press, an Israeli defense official said the purpose of the latest call-up was to provide relief for troops currently on the Gaza firing line. However, Israeli officials have also said they do not rule out broadening operations in the coming days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fifty-six Israeli soldiers and three civilians on the Israeli side have been killed since the offensive began, as Palestinians have fired hundreds of rockets at Israel -- some reaching major cities -- and carried out attacks through tunnels beneath the heavily guarded frontier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel has called up a total of 86,000 reserves during the Gaza war, which it launched to try to end rocket fire from Hamas and other armed groups. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli attacks in the strip continued Thursday, with witnesses saying that munitions struck the Omar Ibn al-Khatab mosque next to a U.N. school in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. Israeli fire near another U.N. school in Gaza killed more than a dozen people the day before, drawing international condemnation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The strike in Beit Lahiya early Thursday damaged water tanks on the roof of a building near the mosque, sending shrapnel flying into the adjacent school compound, where dozens of Palestinians displaced by the fighting had taken shelter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The shrapnel from the strike on the mosque hit people who were in the street and at the entrance of the school,\" said Sami Salebi, an area resident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra said at least 15 people were wounded, with three of them in critical condition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kifah Rafati, 40, was being treated for shrapnel injuries at the nearby Kamal Adwan Hospital. She said she and her six children had been sleeping in a classroom facing the mosque when the explosion went off. \"There is no safety anywhere,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday Israeli tank shells struck a U.N. school in the Jebaliya refugee camp where some 3,300 Gazans had crammed in to seek refuge from the fighting, killing at least 17 people. The military said it was responding to mortar fire coming from the area of the school. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the deadly school shelling \"outrageous\" and \"unjustifiable,\" and demanded an immediate humanitarian cease-fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Nothing is more shameful than attacking sleeping children,\" the U.N. chief said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House also criticized the shelling of the U.N. school in Jebaliya. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are extremely concerned that thousands of internally displaced Palestinians who have been called on by the Israeli military to evacuate their homes are not safe in U.N. designated shelters in Gaza,\" said Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Later on Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike hit a crowded shopping area in the Shijaiyah district in Gaza City, killing at least 16 people, including Palestinian video journalist Rami Rayan, who was wearing a press vest at the time, and wounding more than 200 people, al-Kidra said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday marked a third day of particularly heavy Israeli air and artillery attacks, at a time when Egyptian cease-fire efforts appeared to have stalled. Israeli media said late Wednesday that Israel's Security Cabinet decided to press forward with the operation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egyptian officials, meanwhile, met with an Israeli envoy about Israel's conditions for a cease-fire, including disarming Hamas, according to a high-ranking Egyptian security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to discuss the delicate diplomatic efforts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hamas has said it will only halt fire once it receives guarantees that a Gaza border blockade by Israel and Egypt -- tightened after the Islamic militant group seized power in Gaza in 2007 -- will be lifted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel says it wants to decimate Hamas' rocket-launching capability, diminish its weapons arsenal and demolish the tunnels. It has launched more than 4,000 strikes against Hamas-linked targets, including rocket launchers and mosques where it says weapons were being stored. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli strikes have also hit dozens of homes. Mahmoud Abu Rahma of the Palestinian human rights group Al Mezan said nearly half of the Palestinians killed so far died in their homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli officials have said Hamas uses Gaza's civilians as human shields by firing rockets from crowded neighborhoods. Palestinian militants have fired more than 2,600 rockets at Israel over the past three weeks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Pierre Kraehenbuehl, chief of the U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees, said Israel must try harder to ensure that civilians are not hurt, especially in Gaza, where 1.7 million people are squeezed into a small coastal territory. His agency has opened 80 of its schools to more than 200,000 Palestinians fleeing the violence.

Before, the glasses were sold through vending machines which popped up in major metro areas around the country, as well as a store in Manhattan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because of the short supply, those lucky enough to snag a pair were able to resell the wearable devices for up to $5,000.

So today, Snap begins selling its video-recording sunglasses Spectacles openly online for $129.99 in the U.S. at Spectacles.com. Previously it only dispensed them from Snapbot vending machines in surprise locations and its NYC pop-up store for the last three months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap has now closed that pop-up, and tells me “Snapbots will continue to land in surprising locations around the U.S. following a brief “nap” :) “. Buyers should expect to wait two to four weeks for their Spectacles to ship, and households are limited to 6 pairs. People can also now buy $49.99 charging cases and $9.99 charging cords from Snap, which will no longer be sold on Amazon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for why Snap is expanding Spectacles beyond its buzzy limited release strategy, a spokesperson explains: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As Evan shared in his interview with the WSJ, when we launched, the idea was : ‘We’re going to take a slow approach to rolling them out,’ says Spiegel. ‘It’s about us figuring out if it fits into people’s lives and seeing how they like it.’ Response has been positive since November’s launch so we’re now happy to be able to make Spectacles more readily available — especially for those in the US who have not been able to make it to a Snapbot.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite that positive response, Snap admitted in its IPO filing that “The launch of Spectacles . . . has not generated significant revenue for us,” and notes “We expect to experience production and operating costs related to Spectacles that will exceed the related revenue in the near future.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was that one charging case that melted… but in general, users have been quite pleased with the glasses that can record 10 to 30-seconds of video at a time. The circular, view-with-your-phone-in-any-orientation video format Snap pioneered also gives its Snapchat app something that its popular clone Instagram Stories can’t copy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, Spectacles proved that face-worn computers could be cool if launched by the right brand and kept out of the hands of the geeks at first. Instead of giving developers first access, which created a socially awkward stigma around Google Glass, Snap let its biggest fans chase its Snapbots around the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Snap doesn’t necessarily need to make money directly from Spectacles if it can use them to get more people creating and watching Snaps. But showing it can earn real revenue from hardware could bolster confidence in its public offering. Now the question is what camera this “Camera Company” will release next.\nPassage 4:\nBack in November, Snap Inc. (formerly Snapchat) announced it would be selling camera-enabled sunglasses called Spectacles. The only catch: If you wanted a pair, you had to track down a roving vending machine that popped up in random places around the United States for short periods of time. New York City got a temporary Snap store (it is closed as of today), but long lines and high demand meant you might not be able to get your hands on a pair, even if you waited for hours. (Speaking from experience here.) Starting today, getting your hands on a pair of Spectacles is going to get a whole lot easier; Snap is now selling the glasses via its website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spectacles come in three colors — teal, coral, and the ever-stylish black — and retail for $130. The company is currently only shipping in the United States, so if you’re a Snapchatter abroad, you are out of luck. (Though you could always try eBay. Following the vending machine release last fall, plenty of pairs popped up for resale online if you were willing to pay a significant markup. This will likely happen again now that Specs are more widely available.) The purchase limit is six pairs and glasses should ship in two to four weeks. Pop-up vending machines around the country will also remain a part of Snap’s distribution strategy, though they’ll be taking a short break, a Snap spokesperson confirmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This announcement comes just weeks after Snap’s SEC filing was released in preparation for its initial public offering. According to the filing document, Snap lost $514.6 million last year. Which means Spiegel & Co. only have to sell approximately 4 million pairs of Spectacles to break even this year.\n", "answers": ["Snapchat found itself with a marketing sensation on its hands late last year when it began selling funky-looking sunglasses called Spectacles.

Now, however, parent company Snap is selling them online at Spectacles.com for $129. Just how crazy did demand get? CNBC notes that the glasses were selling for up to $5,000 on secondary markets, adding that its own reporters stood in line for 18 hours to get them.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nIt focuses on a notorious act of white police brutality against mostly Black citizens, in a July 1967, siege at the Motor City’s Algiers Motel, where racism met frustration and blood was wantonly shed. Three young Black men were left dead and many questions were left unanswered. The mostly white Detroit Police Department emerged officially exonerated but not blameless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incident is set against the larger story of the Detroit riots of the same year, which left 43 people dead, nearly 1,200 injured and 7,200 arrested, as the National Guard along with city and state police combined to enforce law and order in a city literally burning from racial tensions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No one would accuse the cops in Detroit of being “too nice,” although Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal — who previously teamed for Zero Dark Thirty and Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker — are careful not to demonize every authority figure. Many of the police and soldiers in the film are appalled by the acts of racism and violence they’re witnessing, among them the commanding officer of trigger-happy young patrol officer Philip Krauss, who is played by cherry-cheeked Will Poulter (The Revenant). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite civil-rights advances and eight years of an African-American U.S. president, the colour of a person’s skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police — who were recently encouraged by President Donald Trump to “please don’t be too nice” when dealing with crime suspects, wink, wink. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on, making Detroit urgent viewing regardless of its character-development flaws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Being appalled, however, isn’t the same as taking full ownership. The commander severely reprimands Krauss for fatally shooting a fleeing looter. He then allows the unrepentant patrolman to return to the streets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Krauss later becomes the central antagonist of the Algiers Motel siege, which is sparked by a teen’s reckless firing of a starter’s pistol at a passing group of National Guardsmen. As cops and soldiers converge on the seedy establishment, seeking the sniper they believe hides inside, fate has also drawn in multiple unlucky bystanders, who thought they’d escaped the riots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among them are rising R&B singer Larry Reed (Algee Smith) and his friend Fred Simple (Jacob Latimore); private security guard Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega); a Vietnam vet named Greene (Anthony Mackie); and two white visitors from Ohio (Hannah Murray and Kaitlyn Dever), who picked a bad time and place to party. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s a lot of characters, and there are more, and here you have the central deficiency of Boal’s script: it tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people. The film is less a character study and more of a situational one; a post-script notes that the Algiers Motel incident has never been fully explained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Detroit opens with a roughly animated history lesson about how poor southern Blacks moved to white-dominated northern cities while affluent whites fled to the suburbs, taking the best jobs with them. The resulting powder keg of inequities exploded not just in Detroit, but across America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And it led to situations like the motel standoff, which Bigelow and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd powerfully depict cinéma vérité style as a cascading series of bad choices, evil intentions and escalating violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Krauss and his fellow racist cops torture the rounded-up motel guests by beating them and threatening to shoot them one by one until the identity of the alleged sniper is disclosed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Watching it unfold over the bulk of the film’s 143-minute running time makes for a grim sit, made all the more so by James Newton Howard’s minimalist score, which at times disappears altogether. Bigelow deserves credit for not trivializing the drama with a soundtrack packed with driving Motown tunes, although a version of Martha and the Vandellas’ “Nowhere To Run” is briefly heard in the film at one point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You don’t need a big backbeat to drive images like these home; Detroit’s deep fury and essential message sears the eye and brain.\nPassage 2:\nThere is no nice or pretty way to tell a story about the systemic oppression and mistreatment of black people in the United States. It's fitting then that Kathryn Bigelow's \" Detroit ,\" an account of the murders of three unarmed black men that took place in the Algiers Motel in late July 1967, is neither — it is an all-out assault on your senses and soul. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is. \"Detroit\" is a well-made and evocative film that is also numbingly brutal with little to no reprieve. And while it might be the only true way to tell this story, it's also one that is not going to be for everyone. The stomach-churning horror begins immediately and does not let up for 2 hours and 23 minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To set the stage for the Algiers Motel, Bigelow begins by speeding through the history of black people in United States with animated acrylics and pounding music — emancipation, the great migration, white flight and the racist zoning practices that led to the overcrowding of black residents in urban pockets. Tensions have already reached a tipping point, and then in the summer of 1967, Detroit police bust an after-hours club in what would become the inciting incident for the riots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three days after the riots begin, a local singing group called The Dramatics are about to go on stage at a big, crowded theater hoping to get their big break, but are interrupted and sent home due to the events outside. The men exit the theater in their sparkly suits into what looks like a war zone. As they run through the streets they assure every cop who isn't already beating someone with a night stick that they're just on their way home. Bigelow shows all of this with handheld, ground level docudrama realism. There is no orienting yourself to the bigger picture, only what is right in front of you. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charismatic lead singer Larry (Algee Smith) and his buddy Fred (Jacob Latimore) decide to peel off and get an $11 room at the Algiers and wait out the night. There they meet two white party girls, a veteran, Greene (a terrific Anthony Mackie), and a provocateur, Carl (Jason Mitchell), who plays around with a starter pistol that eventually catches the attention of the police in the area. The officers, who we've already learned are rotten, storm the motel on the hunt for the sniper they presume is there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The local police, led by a maniacal, hotheaded racist, Krauss (played by the English actor Will Poulter), kills Carl immediately and then continue to terrorize the guests relentlessly with inhuman torture tactics in what seems like an endless sequence of horror upon horror until two more end up dead and they call it a night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bigelow collaborated again with screenwriter Mark Boal on \"Detroit,\" which is perfectly evocative of this specific time and place, but lacking the perspective and illumination that one might hope a 50-year-old event would warrant. Perhaps they wanted to leave conclusions and interpreting to the audience, and as the film notes at the end, no one knows for certain what happened in the Algiers Motel and some of the scenes were pieced together and imagined by the filmmakers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There is some nuance — in the National Guard officer who is horrified by the situation and the local security officer (John Boyega) who only wanted to ease tensions — but not nearly as much as Bigelow and Boal have previously achieved in \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"The Hurt Locker.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also very little insight is given to the victims' lives outside of this event. Maybe that's not the point, though. Maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with \"Detroit\" is the point. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This was America, you think. This is still America. And the movies can't offer a resolution that history hasn't. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Detroit,\" an Annapurna Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"strong violence and pervasive language.\" Running time: 143 minutes.

Inspired in part by the 1992 Los Angeles riots — which were sparked by the acquittal of the LAPD officers who'd beaten Rodney King near to death — the movie's plot involved the murder of black hip-hop artist \"Jeriko One\" by a pair of white Los Angeles cops. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As ambitious as it was unwieldy, Strange Days flopped so hard that Bigelow's career took years to recover. But she landed on her feet, becoming the first and so far only woman to win the Academy Award for best director, for the Iraq war movie The Hurt Locker, which also won best picture. Her follow-up, Zero Dark Thirty, got a Best Picture nod, too. And that's how a sexagenarian woman in Hollywood earns the juice to make a movie like the incendiary new Detroit — Bigelow's vivid, inevitably divisive reenactment of a real 1967 incident wherein three Motor City police officers were charged in the killings of three adolescent black men while the city was under martial law following riots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seemingly in a position to make any movie she wanted, she chose a lightly fictionalized historical drama that bares a striking resemblance to her little-seen Angela Bassett-starring sci-fi flick from 1995. (Strange Days even climaxes in a riot touched off by white police using excessive force on a black suspect, which is where Detroit begins.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until now, the highest-profile accounting of what happened that night was John Hersey's 1968 book The Algiers Motel Incident. (Hersey's estate declined to sell Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal the rights, The New York Times reported.) Detroit isn't as dispassionate as that. Just as the movie Hidden Figures buffed and polished the story told in the eponymous nonfiction book for maximum uplift, Detroit heats and sharpens the facts that formed it for maximum outrage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not that those facts weren't outrageous already: In the case Detroit revisits, the cops were acquitted after the confessions they gave and then recanted were ruled inadmissible in court. That's a cruel irony, because it was in their attempt to coerce confessions from the young men they'd confined in Detroit's Algiers Motel — a $6-a-night flophouse that the law considered a den of sin —that those out-of-control cops resorted to intimidation, torture, and finally murder. (The presence of two white girls from Ohio among all those black men appeared to inflame the cops' further — they accused the women of prostitution, stripping and beating them.) The police claimed a sniper had fired upon them from inside the motel, but they never recovered a rifle from the scene. Detroit subscribes to accounts from several witnesses that the shots that summoned the police came from a starter pistol fired first as a stupid prank, then as an impotent and costly gesture of defiance. Carl Cooper, the 17-year-old who'd allegedly fired it, was the first to die that night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the witnesses who testified for the prosecution, and who said he was assaulted by the accused policemen himself at the Algiers, was a musician. Singer Larry Reed quit his vocal group The Dramatics after that hellish night in 1967; the group broke out a few years later and had a long career without him. (They're still touring.) Reed was one of the incident's key figures that frequent Bigelow collaborator Boal interviewed while working on the movie. And though Boal's research team included Pulitzer Prize-winning Detroit Free Press reporter David Zeman, he has used his artistic license to plug some gaps in the legal record. (Other limits on the film's authenticity were merely budgetary, like the fact that tax incentives resulted in most of Detroit being filmed on location in... Boston.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boal's script commingles real and fictional people: Real-life witnesses Melvin Dismukes, Julie Hysell, and Larry Reed (played onscreen by John Boyega, Hannah Murray, and Algee Smith, respectively), are represented, but the brutal cops in the movie have different names than the officers who were eventually acquitted of the Algiers Motel killings. Their ringleader is played by Will Poulter, a redheaded, freckled 24-year-old English actor whose permanently right-angled eyebrows make him look like the satanic cousin of MAD magazine mascot Alfred E. Neuman. \"We've failed these people,\" he says early in the film, sounding like a peace-loving Hubert Humphrey voter moments before he fatally shoots one of \"these people\" in the back on suspicion of stealing groceries. A detective tells him he's recommending that the District Attorney file murder charges against him, but Poulter's character is sent right back out to active duty in the meantime. Did this really happen? Well, there was a riot on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other credulity-straining aspects of Detroit appear to be factual: For one thing, Dismukes, a private security guard called in to protect a store near the Algiers from looters, was allowed to enter the Algiers with a weird coalition of Detroit cops and National Guardsmen and remain at a crime scene for hours while trying, ineffectually, to prevent the cops from brutalizing their suspects. (Boyega radiates Denzel-like calm in the face of the storm, proving that the way he livened the The Force Awakens was no fluke — he's a bonafide movie star. And to see him in a role where he's essentially helpless is unusual, and compelling.) In real life, Dismukes was charged with the felonious assault of two of the suspects and tried before any of the three cops accused of more serious offenses were; an all-white jury acquitted him. To the extent Detroit addresses this, it implies an unsuccessful attempt by the police to frame Dismukes for their own wrongdoing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I'm also curious to know whether another one of its plot points is historical or invented: When Michigan State Police arrive at the Algiers, the ranking officer among them decides he wants no part of the \"civil rights mix-up\" the Detroit P.D. has already created, so the state troopers just drive away. What's the expression? Huge if true. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bigelow and Boal's recreation of a 50-year-old police brutality case seems bound to be as controversial as their last project, 2012's Zero Dark Thirty. Accused in some quarters of defending the C.I.A.'s use of torture in its decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden, Zero Dark Thirty was really more of a high-tone Rorshach blot for each viewer's opinion of the endless War on Terror. Bigelow has always gone for immersion before reflection or judgment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't think it's up to the filmmaker to judge,\" the director told Washington Post chief film critic Ann Hornaday in a profile published last week. And it's not as though she's only just become interested in identity politics or policing: Long before her metamorphosis into an Oscar-winning maker of Important Films, she made 1990's Blue Steel, a sordid thriller that starred Jamie Lee Curtis as a rookie patrol officer who comes under suspicion after she kills a robbery suspect whose weapon can't be found. It's not a particularly good movie, nor one that would remotely satisfy any 2017 test of its wokeness, but it is at least more evidence that Bigelow was thinking about the problems of policing even when she was just making pulp films. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bigelow's quasi-journalistic style has long alienated some viewers; now it's infuriating them, too. Chicago critic Angelica Jade Bastien slammed Detroit as \"soulless,\" claiming it isn't harsh enough in its condemnation of the misconduct it depicts so mercilessly. Some of her specific complaints about Boal's screenplay — that it makes Melvin Dismukes \"too passive a character,\" or that \"there are also brief, disconcerting moments that present some white cops in a great light\" — come from the moments where Boal hews closest to the firsthand accounts Dismukes and Reed shared with him. Dismukes says he did all he could to prevent the bloodshed, which wasn't much, and Reed says that after he fled the Algiers he was picked up and taken to the hospital by a cop—one who wasn't involved in the nightmare at the hotel. Molding facts into the emotional construct we refer to when use the word story is messy work, even when it's done in good faith. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I've seen Detroit only once, but I'm of the option that Bigelow and Boal have done that good but messy work, resulting in a movie that is maddeningly imperfect but still honorable. The movie opens with a semi-animated sequence that fashions Jacob Lawrence's \"Migration Series\" of paintings into a primer on the mass movement of African-Americans from the rural south to the urban north and west after World War I, and the subsequent white flight to the suburbs. That meant that by the 1960s, Detroit was a majority-black city with a majority-white police force. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's to Bigelow's credit that she doesn't survey the worlds in which she sets her movies in schematic screenwriting terms: Detroit's early scenes, wherein a police raid on an unlicensed nightclub that's hosting a party for returning veterans sparks a riot, includes a few left turns — one of the black party guests who mouths off to the \"pigs\" turns out to be a narc, for example. This detail serves no narrative purpose; it only serves to underscore the absence of trust between the police and the citizens they're sworn to protect and serve. Editor Billy Goldenberg splices in documentary footage with the newly-shot material in this section of the movie, creating a panorama of the climate of mortal fear and volcanic anger between the citizens and the police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We begin to get our bearings when Reed (Algee Smith) and The Dramatics prepare to perform on a revue at the Fox Theatre where they know a Motown A&R; scout will be in the audience. When the police order the performance stopped and the Fox evacuated, and then their bus home is set upon by rioters, Reed and his friend Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) make the ill-fated decision to wait out the curfew poolside at the Algiers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The police occupation of the Algiers forms the film's harrowing, quite long centerpiece. Bigelow uses all her gifts as a communicator of visceral sensation to summon the horror of spending a night under these vicious cops' bootheels. It's nauseating. By the time Anthony Mackie — playing an out-of-work Vietnam vet who gets thanked for his service by being beaten and spat on by cops — agrees never to speak of what he's witnessed, Bigelow and Boal have said all they have to say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Detroit continues on to depict the trial of the three officers, leaking tension as it does. If the intent of this section of the film is to illustrate that these cops are not bad apples but rather the functioning-as-designed armature of an inherently racist justice system, it's only partially successful. The tactics their lawyer (John Krasinski, weirdly) uses to discredit the prosecution's witnesses are as familiar as the Algiers scenes are revolting, and our rage circuits have already blown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maybe it's just impossible for even a scene-setter as skilled as Bigelow to do anything new in a courtroom. The coda she chooses, showing Larry Reed's resolution to continue his musical career in a far more modest fashion than before, has nothing to do with consoling the audience after 135 minutes of trauma. It's about Reed becoming a militant for peace. It's about him making a choice to survive. If nothing else, Detroit gets you thinking about how those might be the same thing.\nPassage 4:\n× Close What is the Tomatometer®?

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The brief news release from Tesla board members—Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Linda Johnson Rice, and James Murdoch—consisted of three sentences: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week, Elon opened a discussion with the board about taking the company private. This included discussion as to how being private could better serve Tesla’s long-term interests, and also addressed the funding for this to occur. The board has met several times over the last week and is taking the appropriate next steps to evaluate this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two board members, venture capital investor Steve Jurvetson as well as Musk’s brother, Kimbal Musk, didn’t sign on to the statement. (Jurvetson has taken leave from Tesla after being accused of sexual harassment.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The statement from members of Tesla Inc.’s TSLA, +5.77% board does show there was a discussion of how he could fund such a bid. But the board’s statement leaves open the crucial question of whether they were satisfied that—as Musk’s surprise tweet put it—he had enough backing to assert “funding secured.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At $420 a share, the price at which Musk tweeted he was considering setting the bid, the deal would be valued at $72 billion before debt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related: A Tesla buyout would be the largest in history—by a wide margin NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tesla shares were down more than 1% early Wednesday, after surging by about 11% on Tuesday. The electric-car maker’s stock has climbed by 21% so far this year. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +3.29% is set for a year-to-date gain of 3.5%, the S&P 500 index SPX, +3.43% is on track for a return of 6.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +4.26% has advanced by more than 14% so far this year, according to FactSet data. Tesla’s run-up comes despite the company being a consistent target of investors aiming to short the its stock, or bet against Tesla’s shares rising. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another crucial question raised by the statement is the timing. “Last week” predates Tesla’s filing on Monday of its 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which didn’t mention such discussions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR News of a takeover would certainly be considered material, yet it wasn’t disclosed until Musk’s tweet on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another question is what the “appropriate next steps” are, though that’s probably the imminent formation of a committee to evaluate the bid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What was left out of the statement also is worth considering.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A statement was issued by six members of the electric carmaker's board after Mr Musk tweeted to say he had the funding to de-list the company. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The board had \"met several times over the last week\" to discuss going private, the statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They said this \"included discussion as to how being private could better serve Tesla's long-term interests\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Musk said in his tweet on Tuesday that shareholders would be offered $420 (£326) per share, valuing the business at more than $70bn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This would make it the biggest deal of its kind, surpassing the purchase of utility TXU Corp in 2007 for $44bn by a consortium. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The brief statement by six of the nine board directors said Mr Musk had \"opened a discussion\" about taking the company private last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The discussions \"addressed the funding for this to occur\", the six directors added. They did not include Mr Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk, and Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Irregular' announcement NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The board statement came amid questions about how Mr Musk opted to disclose the possible de-listing to investors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While companies are allowed to make announcements via social media, typically they also make a simultaneous regulatory filing, said Andrew M Calamari, a partner at the law firm Finn Dixon & Herling and former director of the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Just in terms of the style of this, it strikes me as very irregular,\" Mr Calamari said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It also raises questions about his intent,\" he added. \"Was he in earnest in what he's saying, or does he have some other motive\" like influencing the stock price. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tesla shares reached a peak of $368 after Mr Musk's tweets on Tuesday, before trading on the stock market was halted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trades resumed later that afternoon, after the company published an email from Mr Musk to employees elaborating on the plans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tesla shares surged close to their all-time high of $385, which they touched almost a year ago, but fluctuated on Wednesday after the board members issued their statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Wild swings' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the staff memo, Mr Musk explained why he wanted to take the company private. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders,\" he wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term,\" he wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added that the company was \"the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market\" - a trading strategy which assumes share prices will fall - so \"being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those traders are likely to have lost money when the share price rose on the announcement about a delisting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Questions continue NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr Musk already owns 20% of the company. He said his intention in taking the company private was not to increase his personal holding and his plan would give existing investors the option to retain their shares. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regulators are likely to be interested in what evidence exists - such as agreements with investors or banks - for Mr Musk's claim that funding was \"secured\", Mr Calamari said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market regulator, has inquired about the issue, the Wall Street Journal reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The structure of the deal also remains ambiguous, said Adam C Pritchard, professor of securities law at the University of Michigan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If more than 2,000 investors opt to retain their shares, then the firm would be subject to the disclosure rules of a public company, he added.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Step 2: Harvest all of your nearest star's energy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Step 3: Harvest all the energy from all the stars in your local galaxy; then move on to another galaxy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Congratulations! Your species now has all the elbow room it needs to grow into a universal superpower. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's one Russian astronomer's perspective, anyway. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev first proposed these three phases (called Level I, II and III) of galactic expansion — which he referred to as the three \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations — in 1962 as a way to measure the energy consumption of increasingly powerful societies. Recently, a paper posted June 13 to the preprint journal arXiv.org has revived Kardashev's model and added a new, apocalyptic twist. [13 Ways to Hunt Intelligent Aliens] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the author of the paper, Dan Hooper — a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago — harvesting energy from distant stars isn't just the best way to increase a civilization's available resources. It's also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving that civilization totally alone in the vastness of space. (This study has yet to be peer-reviewed.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" Hooper wrote in the new paper. Over the next approximately 100 billion years, the stars beyond our Local Group, or a group of gravitationally bound galaxies that includes the Milky Way, will fall beyond the cosmic horizon, meaning an observer here could never retrieve information from them over the course of the age of the universe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At that point, \"the stars become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them,\" Hooper wrote in the paper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In other words, if humans hope to meet aliens in distant galaxies, it'll be a race against dark energy, that mysterious force thought to be uncontrollably stretching our universe farther and farther apart. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That, of course, is how we'll find the aliens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Any advanced civilization worth their starships would understand the grim reality of universal expansion, Hooper wrote, and they wouldn't just sit around idly while the universe literally passed them by. Rather, they would capture stars from other galaxies, reel them in and harvest their energy first, before those stars (and their energy) became inaccessible forever. [12 Possible Reasons We Haven't Found Aliens] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Given the inevitability of the encroaching horizon, any sufficiently advanced civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will expand throughout the universe, attempting to secure as many stars as possible before they become permanently inaccessible,\" Hooper wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, how do you lasso a star in the first place? Scientists and science-fiction authors alike have pondered this question for decades, and their favored answer is this: Throw a giant net around it, of course. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This net wouldn't be made of twine or even metal, but of satellites — a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites known as \"Dyson spheres.\" Such a colossal cloud of harvesters could permanently hover around a star, beaming energy back to a nearby planet — or, as Hooper proposed in his new paper, actually use that star's energy to accelerate the whole ball of fire back toward the planet that wanted to use it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This may seem like a tall order for humans, who are still bumbling around Level I of Kardashev's scale. (Carl Sagan placed us at about a 0.7 in 1973). But some scientists think there could be alien civilizations thousands, or even millions, of years older than ours who are already well into their Level III, star-harvesting phase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And if another civilization has indeed begun rearranging the stars, it may not be long before Earthlings notice them, Hooper wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Those stars that are currently en route to the central civilization could be visible as a result of the propulsion that they are currently undergoing,\" Hooper wrote. \"Such acceleration would necessarily require large amounts of energy and likely produce significant fluxes of electromagnetic radiation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Beyond watching for those stars being dragged unceremoniously across distant galaxies, astronomers could also keep an eye out for the unusual galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away from them, Hooper wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These hypothetical, star-harvesting aliens will probably be picky, Hooper noted: Teeny-tiny stars, hundreds of times smaller than Earth's sun, wouldn't produce enough radiation to be useful; significantly larger stars, on the other hand, would likely be too close to going supernova to be used as a viable battery. Only stars with a mass about 20 to 100 times the mass of our sun would be viable candidates for capturing and hauling back to the home galaxy, Hooper said. And because solar objects in that mass range radiate certain wavelengths of light more than others, alien star harvesting would show up in the light signatures from these galaxies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The spectrum of starlight from a galaxy that has had its useful stars harvested by an advanced civilization would be dominated by massive stars and thus peak at longer wavelengths than otherwise would have been the case,\" Hooper said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Humans likely don't have precise enough instruments yet to detect these unusual light signatures beaming from the depths of the universe, Hooper wrote. Hopefully, astronomers will develop them before our sun becomes another flaming marble in some distant civilization's collection.

By creating a swarm of satellites in a spherical shell, they could harness much of the power of their star. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described spherical, energy-trapping alien structures in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\": NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Not only was every solar system now surrounded by a gauze of light traps, which focused the escaping solar energy for intelligent use, so that the whole galaxy was dimmed, but many stars that were not suited to be suns were disintegrated, and rifled of their prodigious stores of sub-atomic energy.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Incredible Technology: How to Search for Advanced Alien Civilizations NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recalling Stapledon's description, physicist Freeman Dysonproposed similar structures in a scientific paper in 1960. Dyson realized that alien civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation. Dyson proposed that really advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems, perhaps dismantling planets to form a shellof satellites around their star to capture its energy. [13 Ways to Hunt Intelligent Aliens] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev proposed in 1962 that very old and advanced civilizations would be of three types: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Type I civilization harnesses all the resources of a planet. Carl Saganestimated that Earth rates about 0.7 on the scale. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Type II civilization harnesses all the radiation of a star. Humans might reach Type II in a few thousand years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Type III civilization harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. Humans might reach Type III in a few hundred thousand to a million years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A solid shell around a star would be gravitationally unstable, and would probably require more material than all of the planets of a solar system could provide. Instead, practical Dyson sphereswould be made from millions of individual solar-collecting satellites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Solar sails could remain in place by balancing against the pressure of light from the sun. The satellite would not be in orbit, it would actually hover in space. Such a satellite is called a \"statite.\" Rings of statites would form a cloud around the star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dyson spheres and other mega-structures appear frequently in science fiction. In his 1970 novel \"Ringworld,\" Larry Niven features a ring-shaped artificial structure girdling an alien star. In the 1992 “Star Trek: The Next Generation” episode \"Relics,\" the starship Enterpriseencounters a Dyson sphere in the form of a rigid shell surrounding a star.

She has battled with reoocurring infections over the latest months and was then hospitalized for further testing.The tests revealed that Oakleigh has stage 3 kidney reflux.This is rather common with this condition, but the bacteria associated with her infection was a dangerous, antibiotic resistant strain of Pseudomonas.While she was in the hospital, tests were done on her heart which revealed moderate ASD and pulmonary stenosis.This is especially concerning when you consider the infection and the involvement of the kidneys.Oakleigh is currently scheduled for surgery at the end of this month.They will be operating to fix the reflux in her left kidney, which now has 22% functionality, in hopes to eliminate future infections.This will be about a 4 ½ hour procedure.Her left kidney is actually 2 kidneys, with 2 different ureters which will have to be cut back to a length that will prevent reflux.She will also have to have a pocket on the outside of the kidney removed.The next step after healing from the surgery is to meet with the cardiologist to discuss additional testing for her heart condition.Oakleigh has a long road ahead of her, but God has her hand every step of the way and for that we are extreemly thankful.Oakleigh is surrounded by a loving and supportive family and on their behalf, we thank you for your support.God Bless!\nPassage 2:\nWhat is a pseudomonas infection? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A pseudomonas infection is caused by a very common type of bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa (say \"soo-duh-MOH-nuss ay-roo-jee-NOH-suh\"). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Healthy people often carry these bacteria around without knowing it and without having any problems. Sometimes these germs cause minor problems like swimmer's ear and hot tub rash. But for people who are weak or ill, these germs can cause very serious-even deadly-infections in any part of the body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recommended Related to Health A-Z Aspergillosis Important It is possible that the main title of the report Aspergillosis is not the name you expected. Please check the synonyms listing to find the alternate name(s) and disorder subdivision(s) covered by this report. Read the Aspergillosis article > > NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The infections are hard to treat because the bacteria can resist many types of antibiotics, the medicines normally used to kill bacteria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Who gets this infection? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People in the hospital may get this infection. In hospitals, the bacteria can spread through medical equipment, cleaning solutions, and other equipment. They can even spread through food. When they spread to patients who are weak because of illness, surgery, or treatment, they can cause very serious infections. For example, pseudomonas is one of the main causes of pneumonia in patients who are on breathing machines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Burn victims and people with puncture wounds may get dangerous pseudomonas infections of the blood, bone, or urinary tract. The bacteria can also get into the body through IV needles or catheters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These bacteria like moist environments, such as hot tubs and swimming pools, where they can cause a skin rash or swimmer's ear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People who wear contact lenses can get serious eye infections if the bacteria get into their contact lens solutions. This can happen if you aren't careful about keeping your contact lenses and equipment sterile. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What are the symptoms? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Symptoms depend on where the infection is. If it's in a wound, there may be green-blue pus in or around the area. If you have swimmer's ear, your ear aches. If the infection causes pneumonia, you may get a cough. When the infections are elsewhere in the body, you may have a fever and feel tired. But all pseudomonas infections can make you very sick if they spread through the bloodstream (septicemia). A serious infection can cause symptoms of high fever, chills, confusion, and shock.\nPassage 3:\nOKLAHOMA CITY - An Oklahoma infant is fighting for her life inside a metro hospital.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nWater from the Mt. Tabor Reservoir system tested clean of urine-related toxins Thursday, news that came as no surprise to Water Bureau administrators yet also did not change their decision to dump 38 million gallons after a man peed in the Southeast Portland storage pool a day earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR City leaders said they were going ahead with plans to drain the water in Reservoir 5 to ensure no health risks to Portland water customers. The decision to empty and clean the reservoir has drawn mention of Portland -- much of it disbelieving or out-and-out derisive -- by national and international news media. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The chief point of contention: Reservoir 5 can hold up to 50 million gallons of water. The typical adult human bladder can hold two or so cups of urine. So the possibility someone getting sick because of Wednesday morning’s incident is, as Water Bureau officials acknowledge, slight at best. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “From a public health protection standpoint, it’s not necessary to get rid of the water,” said Anna Harding, co-director of the School of Biological and Population Health Sciences at Oregon State University. “The urine, which has very few microorganisms to begin with, would be very, very, very, very diluted.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, city officials say, any risk is too much. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The professionals told me this is the way to go. I’m following their advice. We’ve got plenty of water, so we will go ahead and take the safest course,” said City Commissioner Nick Fish, who oversees the utility. “People can feel free to second guess, but this is not a debate. This is the best public health decision.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second-guessing came from far and wide Thursday, including the leading advocate of a May ballot measure to switch control of the city’s water away from the City Council to an independently elected water district board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kent Craford, a former lobbyist for large industrial water customers and co-petitioner of the ballot measure, said he thinks flushing 38 million gallons is a bad idea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a public relations decision,\" he said. \"I wouldn’t waste all that water, all that money.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Craford would not speculate whether the water board he’s proposing would feel the same. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That would be up to the board, up to the managers,” he said. “Our belief is that a water district board will make better decisions than the City Council, and that they would ensure better management than what we have right now.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The debate about dumping or keeping the water is uniquely Portland with roots in the city’s multi-year battle against new federal mandates on open-air reservoirs. Portland leaders opted to stop fighting last year, and Mt. Tabor’s open reservoir system must be disconnected from the city water system by the end of 2015. The open-air reservoir at Washington Park must go offline by the end of 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Politics had no impact on our decision in this case,” Fish said. “But this is Mt. Tabor and the reservoirs, and everything that happens up there is evaluated through a political prism. I know people are going to second guess. That’s their right.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR -- Anna Griffin NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR\nPassage 2:\nUpdate: Kavanaugh and Vocativ are now reporting that the paperwork on this case lists an incorrect last name for the man accused of urinating in the reservoir.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 18-year-old caught on video hanging around the Mt. Tabor Reservoir system early Wednesday morning has granted his first interview to the online news magazine Vocativ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the free-flowing, profanity-laced conversation with former Oregonian reporter Shane Dixon Kavanaugh, Delynn said he did not urinate in the water: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Everybody thinks it’s funny and a joke and I’m going to be on the news,” he says, flicking the cigarette butt into a nearby bush. “It’s no … joke, dude. I don’t want people thinkin’ that Dallas is dumb ass because he pissed in the … water. In our drinking water. Yeah, that’s … awesome. I mean, wouldn’t you be pissed about that?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead, Delynn said he urinated on the wall next to Reservoir 5. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Delynn and two friends were given written citations for trespassing – Delynn also was written up for urinating somewhere other than a park bathroom – and barred from Mt. Tabor for 30 days. Portland Water Bureau officials are working with the Multnomah County District Attorney to determine whether there are criminal charges to be filed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Delynn also told Kavanaugh he thinks it's silly to flush 38 million gallons of water: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Like, how they can do that?” says Delynn. “How can they be like, ‘Yeah, we’re gonna flush all that water.’ Dude, I’ve seen dead birds in there.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Yeah, it’s fucking retarded dude,” Swonger says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an exclusive, expletive-filled interview with Vocativ outside his mother’s home Thursday, the 18-year-old insisted that his piss never trickled into Portland’s drinking supply. He also lamented the looming reality that this story will make him a national (and international) laughing stock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Everybody thinks it’s funny and a joke and I’m going to be on the news,” he says, flicking the cigarette butt into a nearby bush. “It’s no fuckin’ joke, dude.

I mean, wouldn’t you be pissed about that?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The night that launched the whiz-seen-round-the-world had started off on a more feel-good note for Swonger. He says he had moved back to town that very day from St. Helens, which is 30 miles north of Portland, where he had been living with his dad. Eager to shred with some friends, he and two buddies went to skateboard at Mount Tabor Park after hours, which is home to three of the city’s five uncovered drinking water reservoirs – and a handful of excellent hill runs. After bombing down the park’s western slope, nature began to call Swonger. It was around 1 a.m. and the three friends, along with two other people they met in the park, were near one of the reservoirs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was like, ‘Dudes I have to piss so bad,’” he says. “So I just went over to the wall [of the reservoir].” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I leaned up against the wall and pissed on it,” he says. “Right there on the wall, dude. I don’t know else how to describe it.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Water Bureau officials, however, insist Swonger took a leek in the drink. “When you see the video, he’s leaning right up because he has to get his little wee wee right up to the iron bars,” bureau administrator Davd Shaff told the Oregonian. “There’s really no doubt what he’s doing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Water Bureau security and Portland Police officers later stopped Swonger and his two friends, identified as Trey McDaniel and Daniel McDonald, and cited all three with trespassing. Swonger was also cited for public urination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While human pee is not a health hazard – and scores of animals piss, shit and die in Mount Tabor’s reservoirs every year – the city says it will dump a total of 38 million gallons of water, even though test results on Thursday showed no signs of water contamination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Like, how they can do that?” says Swonger. “How can they be like, ‘Yeah, we’re gonna flush all that water.’ Dude, I’ve seen dead birds in there. During the summer time I’ve see hella dead animals in there. Like dead squirrels and shit. I mean, really, dude?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yes, really. In 2011, city officials flushed 7.8 million gallons of reservoir water from Mount Tabor after another man decided to unzip and rip.

Hopefully we’ll do it well.” Success for me would’ve been feeling like I figured it out. That I got to express the things I wanted to. It was never “I want this to be a cultural touchstone . . . but only for a very small portion of America.” And I was hoping to stay on TV longer than nine months this time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Daily Show premiered on Comedy Central on July 22, 1996, at 11:30 P.M. The format loosely tracked that of a conventional newscast: five or so opening minutes called “Headlines,” read by former ESPN anchor Craig Kilborn, followed by “Other News,” then usually a pre-taped “field piece” with a correspondent, and finishing up with Kilborn interviewing an actor or a musician. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some segments played off the hard news of the day, like the presidential contest between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton. “There was more of a pop-culture-and-lifestyle component only because what we were satirizing—particularly local news—was doing a lot of that stuff,” co-creator Lizz Winstead says. “We would make fun of the conventions of news. Like when TV reporters talk, how do you create drama in a story that doesn’t exist?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The day-to-day creative process of the first few years of The Daily Show centered on Winstead, fellow co-creator Madeleine Smithberg, and the writing staff. “My first day on the job,” Winstead says, “I have to pull the writers into my office and say, ‘Guys, you can’t have your mushroom dealer come up to the office.’ ” Kilborn came up with the signature “Five Questions” conceit for guest interviews, but otherwise largely read from the script. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In November 1996, Comedy Central’s executives moved The Daily Show to 11 P.M., to replace Bill Maher’s Politically Incorrect, which had jumped to ABC, but also to counter-program the late local news. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kilborn’s Daily Show would peak at a nightly average of 357,000, yet Kilborn’s audience was growing, and the show was generating critical buzz. Perhaps more important than the chatter was the fact that it was indeed reaching the younger male viewers Comedy Central president Doug Herzog had targeted in the first place. The combination caught the attention of CBS, and in 1998 it offered Kilborn the slot following Late Night with David Letterman, at 12:30 A.M. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He starts to get a little heat, we’re starting to get a little attention with The Daily Show,” Herzog says, “and then the next thing you know Kilborn goes and signs with CBS without even telling us.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Panic, followed by auditions: David Alan Grier, Michael McKean, Greg Proops, Bill Weir, and Mike Rowe came to the studio and sat in the host’s chair. Daily Show correspondents Beth Littleford and Stephen Colbert got tryouts, too. But Herzog and other Comedy Central executives wondered about a black-leather-jacket-wearing stand-up comic, a guy who had hosted a short-lived MTV talk show produced by Smithberg. He had lost out to Conan O’Brien as Letterman’s NBC replacement; he had written a book of satirical essays; he had played Eve Harrington to Garry Shandling’s Margo Channing on The Larry Sanders Show; and lately he’d had some supporting roles in Hollywood rom-coms. Herzog didn’t think the highly regarded, slightly adrift comedian would be interested in the job. But, hey, what did he have to lose in buying lunch for Jon Stewart? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From The Neal Peters Collection. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JAMES DIXON (manager for Jon Stewart, 1987-): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After The Jon Stewart Show was canceled, he was . . . not burnt on being on TV, but he wanted to kind of wet his feet with film. We had this nice deal with Harvey Weinstein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: At the time, I was obviously making my mark in such films as Wishful Thinking and Dancing with Architecture, or Dancing About . . . Oh, no. They ended up calling it something else. Playing by Heart, I think it was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Getting fired from the talk show was the real turning point for me. Because I thought that, after appearing on Letterman, now I’m a made man. I thought losing The Jon Stewart Show meant I was an unmade man. I realized you still have to make your act better. The goal is to produce, the goal is to make things. So I spent some time writing and performing on The Larry Sanders Show, and I learned a lot from Garry Shandling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JUDD APATOW (stand-up comic, writer, director): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Garry had the foresight to write about the talk-show wars and this very subtle aspect of it, which is you support a young comedian, and slowly the network likes him more than it likes you, and then that younger guy, in ways that he understands and might not understand, slowly pushes you out of your job. Similar to what really happened with Leno and Conan and Fallon. So there was a moment when Garry was considering continuing The Larry Sanders Show and changing the name of it to The John Stewart Show, with an h so it wouldn’t really be Jon. Everyone was excited about it for a while, but it went away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: The Daily Show wasn’t necessarily on the radar. I think they called and said, “Hey, man, would you be interested in talking about this?”—something along those lines, something as romantic as that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JAMES DIXON: I definitely advocated for him to do it. I just said to him, “You can put this through your prism. You can make it smarter and different than what it’s been.” Now, I definitely didn’t see the show becoming the political lightning rod that it evolved into. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DOUG HERZOG (executive, MTV, 1984-95; president, Comedy Central, 1995-98; executive, Viacom, 2004-): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the summer of ‘98, when we announced that Jon was going to take over The Daily Show, we had a little press conference in the lobby of the old Comedy Central offices. And Stephen Colbert showed up, as a member of the press representing The Daily Show, wanting to know why he didn’t get the job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEPHEN COLBERT (correspondent, 1997-2005): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You told me he wasn’t funny.” That’s what Jon said to Doug Herzog. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MATT LABOV (publicist for Jon Stewart, 1994-2008): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The stakes for Jon were fairly high at that point, because he’s not a super-young guy anymore, and he’s had shots, and people easily disappear and go into the woodwork. He didn’t get the Conan job on NBC; he didn’t get the 12:30 job after Letterman. If this doesn’t work on fucking cable, then where would Jon have ended up? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: A couple of months before I officially started as host there was a meeting with the writers and producers. Let’s call that “Jonny’s surprise party.” I knew that the people working on the Kilborn show were rightfully proud of it. It had done well. It was not the sensibility that I thought was right for me, and so when they approached me for the show, I was pretty clear about the direction I thought I wanted to take it. Seemed like everybody was on board with that, and so this was my first chance to meet with all the people who, I had been told, were so excited about that. So excited. They’re so happy you’re here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And I walked in, and it was a room full of people who, as it turned out, were annoyed that I had an idea about where I wanted to go, who thought that I was going to MTV it up. I was told, “This isn’t about bands. We do a real show here.” I just sat there like “Oh, fuck.” It felt a little bit like “Wow, none of this was in the brochure. The brochure said that this was oceanfront property.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JAMES DIXON: I had to talk Jon down. Not from a tree—from a skyscraper. Because they basically said to him, “Welcome aboard. This is how we do shit here. Grab a chair.” It was bullshit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PAUL RUDD (actor): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Technically I was Jon’s first Daily Show guest interview. I went to the University of Kansas, and my roommate, Stewart Bailey, became a segment producer who was with the show from the very beginning. I’d been on Kilborn’s Daily Show. When Jon replaced Craig, they wanted to do a test show so Jon could get used to the format. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stewart made his debut on Monday, January 11, 1999. His first joke was that Kilborn was “on assignment in Kuala Lumpur.” His first headline, “The Final Blow,” was about the Senate impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. His first guest was Michael J. Fox, then starring on ABC’s Spin City. But Stewart looked, for the first months, very much the guest himself. Other than a new couch and desktop—and blue script pages for Stewart to scribble on portentously, replacing Kilborn’s white paper—the set design was largely unchanged. The theme song, Bob Mould’s “Dog on Fire,” was the same. And Stewart’s suits were so ill-fitting that they looked like they were inherited from his much taller predecessor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Mike Blake/Reuters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JUSTIN MELKMANN (post-production supervisor; segment producer; later supervising producer, video department; 1997-): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the Kilborn era, it was about “How can we seem like we’ve gone too far?” With Jon, we went from creating the news—creating funny spoof headlines—to making fun of the news. That was a big change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MO ROCCA (correspondent, 1998-2003): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly after Jon arrived, we had done a bit about Dana Plato dying, and Jon felt bad about delivering a joke when the end of her life had been so pathetic. We had a meeting where he said he had resolved that the show needed to have a point of view and couldn’t just be the kid at the back of the classroom throwing spitballs in all directions. I remember people trading the kind of glances that said, “Oh shit, this is going to be a disaster.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: To be fair to the writers who stayed from Kilborn’s show, they had a successful thing going. They thought of it as a continuation of their show. I thought it was a new show. To me it wasn’t edgy or provocative to just take napalm to a bush for no reason. You wanted it to be pointed, purposeful, intentional, surgical. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I felt like I walked in there with a very open “O.K., so this will be great,” and it was “Hey, motherfucker, you came here to kill a baby.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR KENT JONES (writer, 1996-2001): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well, I would not agree with that. I don’t remember any of this being as hostile as it has been portrayed. I just don’t. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MADELEINE SMITHBERG (co-creator; executive producer, 1996-2002): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because of the point of view that had been created by Craig Kilborn sitting in the chair, the writers’ role had inflated. Yeah, they were spoiled rotten, because almost every show in late night is talent driven. They got too big for their britches. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: Six or eight weeks in, the writers called me into their office. They’re like, “You can’t change our jokes anymore.” I didn’t know what to say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So after a weekend of pacing and smoking and having tremendous Lincoln-Douglas debates on the couch by myself, I went back in, and it was horrible. I basically told them all to fuck off. “You work for me. And if you don’t like the direction, O.K. I get that. Don’t work here.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “THERE WERE POINTS WHERE I THOUGHT . . . I’VE GOT TO LEAVE,” SAYS STEWART OF THE EARLY TURMOIL. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There were points where I thought, I made the wrong decision. I’ve got to leave. But I don’t give up very easily. It was open hostility, which is so enjoyable. It became that sense of “O.K., let’s arm-wrestle.” This will give you a hint of my personality of grudges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I didn’t really have a game plan. I knew what I didn’t want. But then turning it into what you did want was the next scenario, and that was going to take time, and effort, and accomplices. What I needed most were accomplices. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN (head writer, later executive producer, 1999-2006): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I was living in Los Angeles, working with a bunch of guys from The Onion, selling pilots and doing punch-up on movies. We did a pilot for Fox called Deadline Now, at about the same time The Daily Show was launching. We kind of did the exact opposite. We didn’t want to be winking at the audience. We wanted to play it straight and not really acknowledge we were a comedy show. We hired actors and went about trying to produce a news show that was very much in the spirit of the Onion newspaper. And, frankly, we were quite scornful of the Kilborn Daily Show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our template host, when we’d come up with show ideas, was always Jon Stewart. We loved Jon Stewart. So when it was announced that Jon was taking over The Daily Show, our little comedy-snob nerd group thought it was a bad move. For him. Comedy Central was still pretty second-tier, and that might even be nice. And Jon was the Letterman heir apparent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I got a call from my agent saying, “Listen, Jon is looking for a new head writer, loves The Onion, has heard that you’re kind of the de facto leader of the Onion guys’ group out in L.A. Would you be willing to come out to New York and meet with them?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: I really liked his sensibility. Ben seemed to be concerned with hypocrisy and the silly façades of politics. He seemed to know where the absurdity was, and that was an important change in focus for what we wanted to do. There’s also a certain steeped-in-neurosis bathos that probably was a rhythm that we both clicked on. That similar Jewie Jewerman from Jewville. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The big thing was to find somebody who had thoughts, who cared, who had an opinion. Part of what The Onion is, and part of what Ben was steeped in, was the idea of deconstruction as your first step of re-creation. So Ben was a natural fit, although he had not had the TV experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From Comedy Central. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: I was friendly with Bob Odenkirk and David Cross. They were kind of like the grand Pooh-Bahs of the alternative-comedy scene in L.A.—Sarah Silverman, Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt. It was that whole wave of comics. Bob and David said The Daily Show sounded like a great opportunity. So I sublet my apartment, sold my Harley, found someone to take my dog for a while, and came to New York with three duffel bags. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: Ben walked into a buzz saw. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: I’m not going to talk shit about anybody. But the staff had its allegiances, and the things that they liked to do, and the way they liked to do it. Now you’ve got this guy, Jon, who is a writer, who has a strong point of view. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LIZZ WINSTEAD (co-creator; head writer, correspondent, 1996-1998): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As much as I loved the original writers, I created some little monsters. Once Jon realized he needed to take charge, you can’t afford to have people who are not in the Jon Stewart business. And so there’s a bit of Kool-Aid drinking that has to take place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Karlin arrived as head writer in April 1999 and quickly formed a complementary duo with Stewart. Karlin pushed for a higher quotient of righteous anger in The Daily Show’s jokes; Stewart had an innate sense of what would get big laughs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: We were very kindred spirits, with very similar points of view, and my critique of the show was very much in line with his problems with the show: Why are we going after these helpless targets? Maybe we should focus the power of this kind of big news show on things that are actually newsworthy, rather than just look through the paper for what seems funny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clashes, pitting Stewart and Karlin against some of the holdover Kilborn writers, would flare for the next year, with one confrontation—which became known inside the show as “the fuck-you meeting”—being leaked to the New York Post’s “Page Six.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: I think that was the meeting where I said, “You’re not a group. You’re not a unit. You’re not ‘the writers.’ You’re individual writers that have been hired, and you will be judged within that.” It was just an attempt to reclaim some semblance of order. It was an absolute flat-out power struggle, but one that I felt blindsided by. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: At one point during the battle for the heart and soul of the show, one of the writers snuck into Madeleine’s office and replaced some of the items on the board that tracks the stories we’re doing with personal insults. Some of them were about me; some were about other people. It was the most juvenile thing in the world. Jon and I used to have this thing: crazy out, sane in. We wanted to try to build a show of smart, funny, reasonable people with a similar vision who were hard workers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An enormous step in that direction was Karlin’s first addition to the writing staff: a dizzyingly fast-thinking, cheerfully caustic 27-year-old who would become a major figure in the creative life of The Daily Show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DAVID JAVERBAUM (writer, later executive producer, 1999-2010): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I’d gone to Harvard and written for the Lampoon and Hasty Pudding, then I went to graduate school for musical-theater composition, at N.Y.U. It’s arguably the most useless master’s degree even by master’s-degree standards. I had a lot of creative things I was interested in, but I had no idea what I wanted to do. I was temping for three years at law firms and Merrill Lynch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I knew Ben Karlin from a teen tour that we were on together, the thing where Jewish middle-class kids go around the country and pretend to rough it for six weeks. Ben, after college at Wisconsin, wound up working at The Onion, and he said, “Do you want to contribute?” So I began writing a lot of Onion headlines and some articles, and I had the idea for the book Our Dumb Century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then I spent a year at Letterman as a writer, and I hated that. Not the people, per se, but it all comes from the top down, and Letterman, even at that point, which was ‘98 to ‘99, was just a detached, aloof figure who would stay there for, like, 13 hours a day for no reason. And I quit. I was making six figures. I’d never made the upper half of five before, but it just was not worth it. It was crushing my soul. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ben was hired as the head writer for The Daily Show, and once again he called me and said, “Are you interested in writing?” So I owe Ben for both of those opportunities. I think I was Ben’s first writing hire, in July 1999. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: D.J. has genius-like qualities, almost to the point where—it’s not Asperger-y, because he’s a funny, normal guy. But the way he can hold information, the speed with which his mind works, it’s almost like he’s got a broken brain that works really well in this way. I’ve known him since he was 16 years old. He always was like this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Usually in a writers’ room you know that this guy is my joke guy, that one is my story guy, that’s my structure person. And D.J. has the ability to pitch individual jokes that are funny; he can come up with overarching structures that are funny; he can take over someone’s script and make it better. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Karlin, and now Javerbaum, Stewart had hired invaluable off-camera allies. But he quickly recognized that he had inherited an indispensable on-camera co-conspirator. Stephen Colbert had a subversive streak that was greatly abetted by the fact that he looked like a trustworthy middle-American insurance salesman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Al Levine/Comedy Central. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEPHEN COLBERT: It was a complete happy accident that I ended up at The Daily Show. I had been working for ABC at The Dana Carvey Show in 1996. That show got canceled, my wife wasn’t working, and we had a baby. I desperately needed a job. Someone from the entertainment division recommended to the news division that if they were looking for somebody who was funny but looked really straight, for a correspondent for Good Morning America, that they should consider me. They hired me. I did exactly two reports. Only one of which ever made it to air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After those two reports, I pitched 20 stories in a row that got shot down. At the same time, my agent, James Dixon, who also represented Madeleine Smithberg, said, “You should meet with Madeleine. She’s doing this other show, and I bet that they would do those stories.” They had me on for a trial basis, and for the next nine months I worked at The Daily Show occasionally, during Craig Kilborn’s second year. But it was totally a day job. I never expected to stay, because I did sketch comedy and I wrote, and I really didn’t think that The Daily Show was going to go anyplace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: The first bit Stephen did on the show after I arrived, I think it was something about baby-back ribs. You could just feel: “This guy knows how to perform in a scene, is present, has an ease with language.” The key then was “What do we do with that?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEPHEN COLBERT: I don’t really know why Jon and I worked together so well. It’s hard to quantify, but it happened very early. When Jon first got there, he had a rough ride with some of the people who had worked with Craig. But I immediately knew he was a guy I should listen to. I saw how thoughtful he wanted to be about political comedy and how he invited us to have our own thoughts, invest the jokes with our own beliefs. And maybe he thought he could trust me. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Changing the lineup of correspondents and contributors, the on-air faces of the show, was crucial, if less contentious. A. Whitney Brown and Brian Unger left when Kilborn did; Colbert, Rocca, Beth Littleford, Frank DeCaro, and Stacey Grenrock Woods stayed on. Stewart’s first correspondent addition was Vance DeGeneres. Then Colbert helped recruit another major talent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL (correspondent, 1999-2003): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I got a call from Stephen Colbert. He and I were on The Dana Carvey Show together in the spring of 1996, and one of the sketches that we did was called “Waiters Who Are Nauseated by Food.” And Madeleine Smithberg, who had hired Stephen onto The Daily Show, saw that and asked who I was—asked Stephen—and then Stephen called me and said, “Would you be interested maybe in doing a field piece?” And then Madeleine called and followed up and asked if I’d do a field piece out here in Los Angeles. Nancy [Walls Carell] and I were living out here at the time, and I had a holding deal with ABC. So we were just watching a lot of the Game Show Network. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I REALLY DIDN’T THINK The Daily Show WAS GOING TO GO ANYPLACE,” SAYS COLBERT. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We decided to stage the field piece right underneath the HOLLYWOOD sign, up in the Hills, and that I was going to do the walk-and-talk as I was essentially walking up the side of a mountain, and obviously play up the fact that I was really out of shape, that it was a very bad correspondent to have chosen for a walk-and-talk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apparently Madeleine really liked that moment within the piece and thought that that was a good choice. They asked if I’d move out to New York and be a regular on The Daily Show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No one was really familiar with this show. My agent didn’t see it as a positive step in my career. Let’s put it that way. They just saw it as a little nothing cable show. A job, but nothing that was going to amount to much. Jon had just become the host about six months before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: Carell, I knew very little about him. These guys didn’t come from stand-up. I knew stand-ups. I knew Dave Attell, I knew Lewis Black. I did not know Vance, Mo, Steve, Stephen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: So much of the writing of The Daily Show actually comes down to brainstorming and coming up with the big-picture ideas. Once we started realizing what an incredible tool Carell and Colbert were, we said we’ve got to bring more of that into the studio. Let’s not just see them once a week or once every two weeks in a field piece. Let’s get both those guys on the show several times a week in one form or another. They’re too talented. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What Stewart and his colleagues could not have known was that they had arrived at the perfect moment, with the media and political worlds on the cusp of upheaval. When Stewart first sat behind the fake anchor desk, the anchors of the real news were still a trio of white male eminences: Tom Brokaw at NBC, Peter Jennings at ABC, and Dan Rather at CBS. But the network news hegemony had been rattled by the arrival of CNN, and especially by its coverage of the 1990 Gulf War. Now Fox News and MSNBC—both launched, coincidentally, within months of The Daily Show’s 1996 debut—were rapidly expanding their footprints on cable systems. Soon the Internet would flatten the traditional TV news industry. And a wised-up, postmodern generation of viewers was hungry for what The Daily Show would soon deliver. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The turn of the century was also a boom time for network newsmagazines. NBC was airing Dateline five nights a week. ABC had 20/20 and Primetime; CBS had 48 Hours. Syndicated shows including Inside Edition added an even cheesier, tabloid flair to the genre. The TV-newsmagazine formula—leaning heavily on sensationalized crime stories, breathless celebrity profiles, and consumer-product scares—was ripe for parody. As were the self-serious anchor-reporter stars of TV newsmagazines: the style of The Daily Show’s correspondents drew special inspiration from the overinflated gravitas of Dateline’s Stone Phillips. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MADELEINE SMITHBERG: I always say that Stone Phillips deserves a “created by” credit for The Daily Show, because I was obsessed with the guy, and we studied him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RORY ALBANESE (production assistant, later executive producer, 1999-2013): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Colbert will tell you his character for years was just Stone Phillips. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Kilborn era, field-department pieces frequently featured obscure eccentrics—say, a man who pulled his own teeth and replaced them with driveway gravel. Those kinds of bits didn’t go away immediately under Stewart. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR KAHANE CORN COOPERMAN (field producer, later co-executive producer, 1996-2015): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I produced a field piece, with Stacey Grenrock Woods as the correspondent, about a guy, Alexander P., who had been a rock star in Ukraine and came here and was now a waiter in a hotel restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This piece may well have been in the works before Jon arrived. But it airs, and after the show you have a postmortem. And Jon was not happy. He said, “Your targets are just wrong. They shouldn’t be people on the fringe. Our targets need to be the people who have a voice, and that’s politicians, and that’s the media.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STACEY GRENROCK WOODS (correspondent, 1998-2003): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I heard Jon was very unhappy with that piece, and I don’t blame him at all. I didn’t like it, either, but it was given to me. I think it ended up being a policy-changing piece. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: The correspondents had their own little thing going on with the field pieces. Jon left it up to us in terms of what sort of characters we were developing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I saw my character as a former local-news anchor who had been demoted to reporting on a nondescript cable news show and was a little bitter about it. Everyone to a certain degree had different variations on blowhard or idiot reporter. But I mean, let’s face it—we didn’t know what we were doing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NANCY WALLS CARELL (correspondent, 1999-2002): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: None of us are correspondents. None of us have backgrounds in journalism. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NANCY WALLS CARELL: Mo was pretty knowledgeable, actually. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEPHEN COLBERT: There was a very specific way we were supposed to present ourselves when we set up field pieces: “I’m from The Daily Show.” “What’s The Daily Show?” “Well, it’s an alternative news-and-entertainment program.” “What channel is it on?” “Well, I don’t know what channel it is where you live. Where we live it’s Channel 29.” Anything other than saying the words “Comedy Central.” We were never allowed to lie, but let’s not advertise we were on Comedy Central, because not being a famous show was really useful to us in the early days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I was the first correspondent to be sued. After a piece ran, a guy claimed I claimed I was from CNN. I never said that. But if you make a man comedically look like Hitler and it turns out that he is a retired lawyer with a lot of time on his hands, you’re going to get sued. That’s the lesson for today, children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: The field pieces with eccentrics and oddballs, those were uncomfortable. For all of us. I almost didn’t . . . I won’t say I almost didn’t do the show, but I had some major reservations about doing it for exactly that reason, because I didn’t like the idea of making fun of people only because they were eccentric or different, and . . . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NANCY WALLS CARELL: Duping them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: Yeah. Shooting fish in a barrel is easy. When you go after someone who is intolerant or racist or has any sort of hateful nature, that’s a different story. I think that’s fair game. So part of what I tried to do with my character is put the impetus on myself, the comedic impetus, that I was the bigger idiot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During his first year as host Stewart devoted far more energy to retooling the staff and the process inside the building. But it was the field department, in a series of excursions to New Hampshire to “cover” the presidential primaries, that really began pointing The Daily Show’s tone and point of view in a new direction. Initially intimidated by the straight political media pack, correspondents Rocca, Walls Carell, DeGeneres, and Carell played jester. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: When we went up to the first Republican debate we had our jackets with “The Daily Show” embroidered on them, and we’re walking around with microphones. It was terrifying because people didn’t know that we were fake. So we could get away with a lot of stuff. Bush looked at us like we were insane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CINDY McCAIN (wife of Senator John McCain): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All of a sudden there were these guys in these crazy jackets, popping up at campaign events, and nobody knew who they were. But they were funny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEW BAILEY (field producer, later co-executive producer, 1996-2005): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was a Republican debate in New Hampshire, so we were going to do a piece from the spin room. And the spin room even then was acknowledged as the least newsworthy event of all time. Our premise was that it’s essentially a parlor game, and if that’s the case, let’s really turn it into a parlor game. I had each of the correspondents asking questions from Trivial Pursuit to the candidates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MO ROCCA: All of us were nervous as hell, and so I just went for it: “Senator McCain, who became the hottest pop star to come out of Iceland in the mid-1990s?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEW BAILEY: Immediately our other correspondents start yelling, “Don’t skirt the question, Senator! You have to answer!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MO ROCCA: And McCain showed why he almost upended George W. Bush in that race, because he played along, making this silly face. I remember the CNN people looking at us like, “O.K., that was funny. But who are you guys?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: When we went up to New Hampshire we were under the mistaken assumption that we had to integrate ourselves with the political media’s process and become them to parody them. Turns out we didn’t have to do that. We had thought, Oh, you’re a political reporter on television, which must mean something. Turns out it doesn’t mean anything. All it means is that somebody pointed a camera at you and lit it. So that was a revelation, and not a positive one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, in December 1999, came a breakthrough—a five-minute segment that pushed past the silly and into the satirical. Carell climbed onto McCain’s bus and changed the entire trajectory of The Daily Show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEW BAILEY: Remember, McCain that year was a huge deal. He won the New Hampshire primary. That was really his moment. And his big gimmick was his bus, the Straight Talk Express. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I was supervising in the field department. Our idea was that we were trying to get on the Straight Talk Express, but we couldn’t. There was a secondary press bus. If you’re in the rollover bus you just don’t feel like you matter. So the premise was going to be: if Steve Carell finally does get on the Straight Talk Express, that means we were at the table with all the big important players. To get on McCain’s bus was a coup for us; it meant that somebody was going to allow us to bring our reindeer games into a legitimate political moment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CINDY McCAIN: The actual press bus, which was completely different from ours, was really awful, in fact. Steve Carell was talking about, did we feed the press, or did we just lock them in the bus? They were pleading with me—is there any way I can get them on the main bus? They were a hoot to be around, so John invited them on the Straight Talk Express. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEW BAILEY: We needed to then have Carell basically ask one question that is going to get us kicked off. The idea was going to be we had a brief moment of glory, we asked a question, and then we lost our privileges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL:) [On board the Straight Talk Express, reading from a legal pad as McCain grins.] Let’s do a lightning round: your favorite book? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SENATOR JOHN McCAIN: For Whom the Bell Tolls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: Favorite movie? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCAIN: Viva Zapata! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CARELL: Charlton Heston? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCAIN: Marlon Brando. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CARELL: Close enough. If I were a tree, I would be a . . . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McCAIN: If I were a tree, I would be a root. [Pause.] What does that mean? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CARELL: Senator, how do you reconcile the fact that you were one of the most vocal critics of pork-barrel politics and yet while you were chairman of the Commerce Committee that committee set a record for unauthorized appropriations? [Four seconds of silence that feel like four hours.] I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means! [McCain looks at ceiling, shrugs in relief, awkwardly slaps hand to his own face. Carell shuffles sheepishly down the bus stairs and out the door, then stands on a highway median.] Oh, they all laughed at my little question. But two things were abundantly clear. It was the wrong question to ask, and I was going to be walking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEW BAILEY: Carell and Nick McKinney, the producer, had pulled the question out of Time on the way there, driving to the shoot. Just the fact that Steve Carell can get those words out of his mouth and that it sounded like something a smart person would say really threw McCain off. There was such a delay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: It was really funny because all of McCain’s handlers . . . you could feel the whole bus tense up. I thought McCain might just laugh it off, or probably give me some sort of joke response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: I remember seeing it in the editing room. I remember Jon called me down, and seeing it and thinking, Yeah, this is what we should be doing. This is the goal. It was one of Carell’s most incredible moments. He asks McCain a question in a way that no journalists were talking to the candidates. And it was like, Oh shit, we are able, in this weird, unintentional way, to add a level of insight to the process that doesn’t exist. That was really, really exciting. It meets the standard of being funny; it meets the standard of being relevant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JOHN McCAIN (U.S. senator, Arizona, 1987-; Republican presidential nominee, 2008): NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That was great. I still remember Steve Carell on the bus. I was certainly aware of Jon and the show early on, and knew they would try to have some fun with us. I wanted to be funny. I wanted these young people to know that I’m a guy with a sense of humor. I’m not some dull, dry, old senator. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BEN KARLIN: That moment, it was the beauty and the weakness of The Daily Show. You had this incredibly pregnant moment where you forced a politician to go off-book, and it was uncomfortable, and it was honest. Then, because of our role as a comedy show, you have to take the air out of it, and it let McCain off the hook. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STEVE CARELL: Yeah, to press it—we really hadn’t set ourselves up in that context to start going after him. It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MO ROCCA: That was the first time we were in The New York Times—in a news-analysis piece, not the TV column. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JON STEWART: The real revelation for the show, covering the 2000 campaign, was that before everything that happens publicly in politics there’s a meeting—so what’s that meeting? That’s what’s interesting. It always struck me as “We’re always covering the wrong thing. We’re always covering the appearance, but we’re never covering that meeting.” When you watch that pack of cameras follow a presidential candidate, you go, “That’s not interesting. What’s interesting is to stand behind them and watch that,” because then you learn a little bit about the process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s when the idea of deconstructing the process came to the fore of how we were going to make the show. Before, it was just . . . we were making jokes. Some of them were insightful; some of them were not. The show came to exist in the space between what they’re telling you in public and the meeting that they had where they decided to do it that way. Seeing that was the aha of “That’s the show.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CINDY McCAIN: I still have those jackets, by the way. I talked them out of their big New Hampshire jackets. They were around John so much, and I finally said, “Look, these jackets are too good. I’ve got to get one from you, please.” They gave them to me. It’s a great souvenir.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Jan. 14, 911 supervisor Tim Medlin received a call from a woman who said she was locked in the trunk of a moving car by her jealous boyfriend. Medlin said it was hard to understand her. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The only thing we knew is it was a female that was very upset, and that she was in the trunk of the car,\" he said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Texting, it was the only way I knew we would probably not get her in trouble,\" Medlin said. \"When I sent a simple text, 'Can you text?' She responded, 'Yes.'

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medlin called the Cumberland County Sheriff's office, who then contacted Verizon Wireless, and was able to locate the phone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The woman also gave authorities the name of her boyfriend - Nicholas Mattevi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once they had a location, Fayetteville police spotted the car, rescued the woman and arrested Mattevi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They located her.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a prime example of technology being used to the fullest at someone's greatest time of need,\" Barbour said. \"We can only receive texts and then text back one another.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bacall, who had a legendary love affair with her first husband Humphrey Bogart and was also married to Jason Robards, was a lifelong dog lover. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was always a dog yearner,\" the New York native told Glenn Close in a 2008 interview for FetchDog.com. \"I didn't have a dog growing up in the city with a working mother. As an only child, I yearned for someone to talk to. When I was 16, we got a champagne-colored Cocker Spaniel and named him Droopy. From the first moment, [Droopy] was very possessive of me. All my dogs have been possessive of me.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Related: Bacall & Bogart: The Story Behind One of Hollywood's Greatest Romances] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From then on, Bacall always had dogs and Sophie was her special companion later in life. She was photographed walking the dog near her Upper West Side apartment and even brought the pup on the red carpet at the Toronto and Berlin film festivals. And when she was promoting her reissued memoir By Myself and Then Some in 2005, Sophie accompanied the star to book signings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bacall leaving money for the care of her dog isn't that unusual — for celebrities or everyday folks who want to provide for their faithful furry friends. However, hotel magnate Leona Helmsley, who was dubbed \"the queen of mean,\" made major headlines when she left a whopping $12 million to her Maltese, Trouble, in 2007. Three years later, fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who committed suicide, left $82,000 of his $26 million estate to his trio of dogs: Minter, Juice, and Callum.

When Dusty Springfield, the British singer of \"Son of a Preacher Man\" died from breast cancer in 2009, her last will and testament included several provisions for her 13-year-old feline, Nicholas. The cat was to only be fed baby food imported to England from the United States, live in a 7-foot indoor tree house, and be serenaded to sleep with a stereo system playing Springfield's hits. The most quirky stipulation of all? That the cat be \"married\" to a female cat of Springfield's friend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After hearing that, Bacall leaving $10,000 for the care of her dog is totally normal.\nPassage 2:\nSilver screen legend Lauren Bacall left behind an estimated $26.6 million estate — and made sure her little dog Sophie would have plenty of bones in her golden years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bacall left $10,000 to one of her sons to ensure Sophie enjoyed the lifestyle to which the papillon had become accustomed. With that chunk of change, Sophie won’t be eating store-brand dog food, but the pooch also wouldn’t be Trouble — as in the dog of late real estate magnate Leona Helmsey, who was left $12 million in her 2007 will. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bacall’s will, signed last fall, also remembered two of her employees — Ilsa Hernandez was left $15,000 and Maria Santos was given $20,000, according to papers filed Friday in Manhattan Surrogate’s Court.

They had two children together. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Outspoken and brassy, Bacall continued making movies and performing on Broadway, where she won Tony Awards for her roles in \"Applause\" in 1970 and \"Woman of the Year\" in 1981. She didn't score an Oscar nomination until after she'd spent 50 years in the business — she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Barbra Streisand's \"The Mirror has Two Faces.\" She lost to actress Juliette Binoche. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Bogart’s death from esophagal cancer, Bacall had a relationship with another legend, crooner Frank Sinatra, but he broke it off.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nWASHINGTON – EPA and Magnolia Waco Properties, LLC, which does business as Magnolia Homes, have reached a settlement to resolve alleged violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule (RRP Rule), related to home renovations conducted without adequate lead paint protections as depicted on the television program Fixer Upper. Under the terms of the settlement, Magnolia will take steps to ensure compliance with lead-based paint regulations in future renovation projects, address lead-based paint hazards at high-risk homes in Waco, Texas, and educate the public to lead-based paint hazards and appropriate renovation procedures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Overview of Company NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Magnolia Waco Properties, LLC, which does business as Magnolia Homes, is a renovation firm that remodels homes in the Waco, Texas area. The firm specializes in renovations that require extensive remodeling of older homes while preserving historical design elements. The activities of Magnolia and similar renovation firms came to EPA’s attention from their depiction on popular television shows. Magnolia’s renovations were depicted on the HGTV series “Fixer Upper” and regularly viewed by well over 3 million households. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Top of Page NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Violations NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EPA’s Residential Property Renovation Rule, also known as the “Renovation, Remodeling and Painting Rule” (RRP Rule), implements a provision that Congress added to the Toxic Substances Control Act to ensure that home renovations would not expose occupants to dangerous levels of lead from the lead-based paint often contained in homes built before 1978. The RRP Rule requires firms performing renovations for compensation in such homes to use specific precautions, including lead safe work practices, to reduce the risk of exposure to lead, unless the firm documents that testing of building components prior to renovation demonstrated less than the regulated concentration of lead in surface coatings on the components. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Video footage of Magnolia’s renovations of older homes appearing in several seasons of “Fixer Upper” reviewed by EPA did not depict the lead-safe work practices normally required by the RRP Rule. After EPA contacted Magnolia with concerns about the company’s compliance, Magnolia took immediate steps to ensure compliance with the RRP Rule, including to obtain RRP certification and training for the firm and its staff and to ensure active compliance across all ongoing renovation projects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EPA’s review of information it obtained with Magnolia’s cooperation found evidence of noncompliance at renovations of 33 properties. Among the violations subsequently alleged by EPA were that Magnolia did not comply with the following requirements and precautions of the RRP Rule: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obtain firm certification from EPA before performing renovations covered by the RRP Rule; NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Assign a certified renovator to such renovations; NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Provide home owners or occupants with an approved pamphlet about lead-based paint hazards prior to the renovation; NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Post signs to clearly define the work area and warn people to remain outside that area; NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Comply with the RRP Rule’s work practice standards, such as closing doors and windows to the interior work areas, covering floor surfaces, ducts and other openings to work areas with plastic sheeting, and covering the ground with plastic sheeting to capture falling paint chips from exterior renovations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Magnolia cooperated with EPA throughout the Agency’s inquiry, volunteering information about its renovation activities and proposing to undertake innovative projects to reduce the prevalence of childhood lead-poisoning in its community and to increase awareness of lead-based paint safety issues associated with renovations in older homes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Top of Page NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Injunctive Relief NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to a civil penalty, this settlement includes relief focused in three areas: compliance management of Magnolia’s own renovation operations, outreach about lead-based paint safety to Magnolia’s national audience, and the reduction of lead-based paint hazards in Magnolia’s local community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Magnolia took immediate steps to ensure the compliance of its own operations with the RRP Rule by becoming an EPA certified renovation firm, obtaining training and renovator certification for staff, and bringing active renovations into compliance. In this settlement, however, Magnolia took a step further in its commitment to compliance by implementing a compliance management program, in which it adopted an enhanced renovation recordkeeping checklist for use by its own staff and by subcontractors doing regulated work and agreed to compile periodic reports to EPA on its compliance implementation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Magnolia also sought to improve the public’s appreciation for the serious hazards of lead-based paint contained in older homes and the precautions necessary to reduce those hazards. First, Magnolia spoke about lead based-paint on an episode of “Fixer Upper” and depicted some of the steps renovation firms must take to minimize those hazards in a segment of its March 21, 2018 episode of “Fixer Upper.” During and after the broadcast of that episode, a “Fixer Upper” co-star Chip Gaines sought to amplify the message about lead-based paint safety with messages to his Twitter followers about the importance of using a professional’s help to check for lead paint and a link to a website with information about lead safety and the RRP Rule. Second, Magnolia proposed a brief stand-alone video further discussing lead-based paint and the RRP Rule to be hosted on its webpage and promoted on social media. Magnolia agreed to post the video within three months of executing this settlement. In the video, Chip Gaines will discuss lead safety and depict some of the safe work practices required by the RRP Rule. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Magnolia also looked for ways to make a concrete difference in its local community. To that end, the company will perform a supplemental environmental project (SEP) to abate lead-based paint hazards in homes or child-occupied facilities in the Waco, Texas area. A significant portion of Waco’s housing stock was built before 1978, and at least one neighborhood has had historically higher exposure to lead-based paint and a higher percentage of elevated blood lead levels in children than the statewide and national averages. Magnolia’s SEP, which will be performed with an independent abatement firm, will reduce the risk of exposure to lead-based paint by targeting the most likely sources of lead-based paint hazards in residences, such as window and door replacement, removal of lead-based paint and dust, permanent enclosure and encapsulation, and replacement of lead-based paint surfaces and fixtures. Magnolia has committed to spend $160,000 on the SEP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Top of Page NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pollutant Impacts NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even though lead-based paint was banned in 1978, it still remains in many homes and apartments across the country. According to HUD’s American Healthy Homes Survey, which was conducted from June 2005 through March 2006, an estimated 37.1 million homes – or 34.9 percent of all homes nationwide – have lead-based paint somewhere in the building. An estimated 34.4 million of these homes were built before 1978. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Top of Page NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health Effects and Environmental Benefits NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lead dust can occur when lead paint deteriorates or is disrupted during home renovation and remodeling activities. Lead exposure can cause a range of health problems, from behavioral disorders and learning disabilities to seizures and death, putting young children at the greatest risk because their nervous systems are still developing. EPA enforces the RRP Rule and other lead rules to protect children and others who are vulnerable to exposure to lead dust that can cause lead poisoning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Top of Page NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Civil Penalty NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Magnolia will pay a civil penalty of $40,000.

The pair’s company, Magnolia Homes, will pay $40,000 to the EPA for alleged lead-paint violations. They are alleged to have not taken the appropriate precautions while renovating homes that contained lead paint in Waco, Texas, for their show. The EPA says that the rules were allegedly violated in 33 different homes, but at least they probably look a lot better. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The violations were noticed because apparently someone at the EPA saw it. The agency said in a statement they had witnessed the violations when they reviewed several seasons of the show, because apparently the EPA has a whole department that’s just people with hangovers binge-watching home-renovation shows with the rest of us. In addition to the fine, Magnolia will pay to produce some lead-awareness bonus content for their web site and social-media accounts. The video will star Chip Gaines and aim to to make fans aware of how to be lead-safe, and hopefully it’ll be ready in time for July 5.\nPassage 3:\nChip and Joanna Gaines, HGTV’s husband-wife Fixer Upper team, have agreed to pay a $40,000 fine by the EPA for the improper use of lead-based paint in their renovations. The couple, who do business as Magnolia Homes, reached a settlement in a case that could have cost them $556,000 in fines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a settlement “information sheet” posted on the EPA’s website (read it here), the agency notes that the “activities of Magnolia and similar renovation firms came to EPA’s attention from their depiction on popular television shows. Magnolia’s renovations were depicted on the HGTV series ‘Fixer Upper’ and regularly viewed by well over 3 million households.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The EPA says Magnolia engaged in “home renovations conducted without adequate lead paint protections as depicted on the television program Fixer Upper.” The series recently completed its fifth and final season on HGTV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the $40,000 fine, the settlement requires Chip Gaines to produce and release an educational video highlighting the dangers of lead-based paint within 90 days. Also, the couple has agreed to spend $160,000 on a lead-abatement project in their hometown of Waco, Texas. The project, to be performed with an independent abatement firm, will reduce the risk of exposure to lead-based paint in at-risk residences by replacing windows and doors, removing lead-based paint and dust, and replacing lead-based paint surfaces and fixtures, among other chores. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The EPA notes that Magnolia has “looked for ways to make a concrete difference in its local community.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also as part of the settlement, “Magnolia will take steps to ensure compliance with lead-based paint regulations in future renovation projects.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the EPA report, video footage of Magnolia’s home renovations appearing over several seasons of Fixer Upper were viewed by the agency. A review of information “obtained with Magnolia’s cooperation” found “evidence of noncompliance at renovations of 33 properties.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “After EPA contacted Magnolia with concerns about the company’s compliance,” the agency writes, “Magnolia took immediate steps to ensure compliance” with agency rules and regulations.

We do not capture any email address.\nPassage 2:\nDramatic shifts in the East African climate may have driven toolmaking advances and the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives by the Middle Stone Age, roughly 320,000 years ago. That’s the implication of discoveries reported in three papers published online March 15 in Science. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Newly excavated Middle Stone Age tools and red pigment chunks from southern Kenya’s Olorgesailie Basin appear to have been part of a long trend of climate-driven behavior changes in members of the Homo genus that amped up in H. sapiens. Locations of food sources can vary unpredictably on changing landscapes. H. sapiens and their precursors responded by foraging over larger areas with increasingly smaller tools, the researchers propose. Obsidian used for the Middle Stone Age tools came from far away, raising the likelihood of long-distance contacts and trading among hominid populations near humankind’s root. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At roughly 320,000 years old, the excavated Middle Stone Age tools are the oldest of their kind, paleoanthropologist Rick Potts and colleagues report in one of the new papers. Researchers had previously estimated that such tools — spearpoints and other small implements struck from prepared chunks of stone — date to no earlier than 280,000 to possibly 300,000 years ago. Other more primitive, handheld cutting stones made of local rock date from around 1.2 million to 499,000 years ago at Olorgesailie. Gradual downsizing of those tools, including oval hand axes, occurred from 615,000 to 499,000 years ago, a stretch characterized by frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions, the scientists say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s not known whether that tool trend continued or if a sudden transition to Middle Stone Age implements happened between 499,000 and 320,000 years ago. Erosion at Olorgesailie artifact sites has destroyed sediment from that time period, leaving the nature of toolmaking during that time gap a mystery. Age estimates relied on measures of the decay of radioactive forms of argon and uranium in volcanic ash layers framing tool-bearing sediment. It’s unclear whether Homo sapiens or a closely related species made Olorgesailie’s Middle Stone Age tools, since no hominid fossils have been found there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Back-and-forth shifts from dry to wet conditions — many happening over only a few years or decades — continued to regularly reshape the Olorgesailie landscape around 320,000 years ago, conclude Potts, of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and colleagues in another of the new papers. That timing coincides roughly with the emergence of H. sapiens (SN: 12/23/17, p. 24). The team’s climate reconstruction is based on microscopic and chemical analyses of the region’s soil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A substantial number of Olorgesailie’s Middle Stone Age tools are made from obsidian that came from at least 25 to 50 kilometers away from the excavation sites. At one Olorgesailie site in particular, 42 percent of more than 3,400 stone artifacts were obsidian. Some of those finds display signs of having been attached to handles, likely as spearpoints, a group led by archaeologist Alison Brooks of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., reports in the third paper. Brooks is also a coauthor on the other studies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Formation of trading networks among dispersed groups of H. sapiens, or possibly among closely related populations, best explains how large amounts of obsidian turned up at Olorgesailie by 320,000 years ago, contends Potts, who coauthored the third paper. “Social networking during a long period of climate variability was a key to success for early Homo sapiens,” he says. “Greater mobility encouraged inventive thinking about how to acquire resources.” Potts has long argued that H. sapiens and close evolutionary relatives evolved to deal with constantly changing environments (SN: 8/20/05, p. 116). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, factors other than climate fluctuations, such as hominid population declines or surges, may also have spurred ancient tool innovations to acquire more or different types of food, cautions archaeologist Yonatan Sahle of the University of Tübingen in Germany. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the obsidian tools, a total of 88 pigment lumps, including two pieces with grinding marks, came from an undetermined distance outside the Olorgesailie vicinity, Brooks’ group says. Pigment applied to one’s body or belongings may have signaled group identity or social status, the researchers suggest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new reports fit with genetic evidence that H. sapiens originated in Africa between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago (SN: 10/28/17, p. 16), says Stone Age archaeologist Marlize Lombard of the University of Johannesburg. Smaller, more specialized Middle Stone Age tools appearing along with pigment “provide strong indicators that by around 300,000 years ago we were well on our way to becoming modern humans in Africa,” she holds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ancient toolmaking approaches varied greatly from one part of Africa to another, with hominids employing diverse mixes of old-school chopping tools and newer, sharp points, says archaeologist John Shea of Stony Brook University in New York. At Olorgesailie and elsewhere, he says, “early Homo sapiens and their immediate African ancestors were at least as smart as the scientists investigating them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Editors’ note: This story was updated on March 21, 2018, to correct the percentage of stone artifacts made from obsidian at one Olorgesailie site.\nPassage 3:\nScientists Are Amazed By Stone Age Tools They Dug Up In Kenya NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enlarge this image toggle caption Jay Reed/NPR Jay Reed/NPR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our ancestors in Kenya's Southern Rift Valley made some pretty innovative tools. And they made them far earlier than previously thought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The oldest innovations were axes designed to be held in the palm of the hand. They were shaped like a tear drop, with a rounded end and a pointed eye. The edges were wavy and sharp. And they look as if they were great at chopping down branches — or chopping up the carcass of a large animal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR toggle caption Jay Reed/NPR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think of the hand axes as the Swiss army knife of the Stone Age,\" says paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, director of the Human Origins program at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and one of the lead scientists in a new study by a team of international scientists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers also found that the next technological revolution, marking the beginning of the Middle Stone Age happened tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the researchers think that long periods of stress from repeated earthquakes and cycles of drought and heavy rains may have pushed these early humans to partner up with neighboring communities to come up with ways to cope. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR toggle caption Jay Reed NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team was digging in a region called Olorgesailie in southern Kenya, an area filled with layers of sediment dating back 1.2 million years. The oldest stone tools discovered there are characteristic of what's called the Acheulian culture of the Early Stone Age and consisted mostly of the hand axes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enlarge this image toggle caption Human Origins Program/Smithsonian Human Origins Program/Smithsonian NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to branch- and carcass-chopping, the axes were likely used to dig for water to drink or tubers to eat. The carcasses probably belonged to large animals like the giant (now extinct) ancestors of hippos, elephants and wild pigs that roamed the grasslands back then. Potts says the ancient humans of that time likely scavenged dead animals, as their heavy, clunky hand axes wouldn't have served well for hunting big game. \"These are very large tools,\" he says. \"They might have been thrown but not very accurately.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR toggle caption Jay Reed/NPR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nevertheless, these hand axes served the ancient humans well for several hundred thousand years — from 1.2 million years ago to 500,000 years ago — and the technology remained largely unchanged during the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But around 320,000 years ago, the ancient humans seem to have switched to an entirely new technology. The scientists found numerous smaller, flatter, sharper stone tools. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools,\" says Potts. These tools were designed for specific purposes — some were used as blades, some as scrapers or spear heads. The scientists report their findings in three new studies published Thursday in the journal Science. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In Olorgesailie, you have the only record of the last million years in Africa,\" says Marta Mirazon Lahr, a paleoanthropologist who wasn't involved in the new study. And it's \"the earliest ever documented Middle Stone Age in the whole continent.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new studies also show that by 320,000 years ago this technology was well established in the region, suggesting that human ancestors likely started developing it even earlier, she says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The technology they have is not a crude, early version of the Middle Stone Age. It is the full-blown Middle Stone Age,\" Lahr says. \"They have stone tools that are small, that are prepared and retouched, that are made with technique thought to come hundreds of thousands of years later.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR toggle caption Jay Reed/NPR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The diversity of stone tools from the Middle Stone Age suggests advanced thinking and planning. \"The flakes are being much more carefully prepared for a particular purpose,\" says Alison Brooks, an anthropologist at George Washington University and an author of the three studies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are fairly small in size, compared to the technology of earlier people. And in addition, they are made with much finer grained material,\" which allowed them to better control shapes and sizes of the stone tools. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We see the ability to produce small triangular points, that look like they were projectile points,\" says Potts. \"They were tapered at the end, so that could have been put on the shaft of something that flew through the air.\" In other words, a potentially lethal spear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So our ancestors likely shifted from scavenging to hunting. An analysis of the fossilized animal bones found in the sediments show that people in that period were eating a range of mammals — which were by now much smaller, and closer in size to the animals of today — including hares, rabbits and springbok and even a couple of species of birds and fishes, says Brooks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And they weren't just picking up nearby stones to create their weapons. Earlier hand axes were made primarily from volcanic basalt, sourced within 2 to 2.5 miles of where these humans lived. The latter weapons were made of stones like obsidian, which originated far from Olorgesailie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR toggle caption Jay Reed/NPR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That black obsidian, that rare rock was being transported, brought in in chunks, from 15 to 30 miles away,\" says Potts. \"We have a couple of rocks that were brought from up to 55 miles away.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These distances are far greater than what modern-day hunter gatherers travel over the course of a year, he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They weren't just traveling long distances and chipping rocks as they go,\" he adds. \"If they did that, then there would have just been small chips of obsidian left at the archaeological sites where we dig. Instead we see large pieces of raw material coming in. The rocks were shaped at Olorgesaile itself.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That kind of exchange of raw materials is a tell-tale sign of exchange between different groups of people, the scientists say. \"In the Middle Stone Age, we begin to see the early stages of social networks, of being aware of another group and exchanging rocks over longer distances.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Potts and his colleagues also find evidence of exchange of brightly colored red and black rocks that were then drilled into, possibly to extract pigment. This is the earliest evidence of the extraction of pigments, says Lahr. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's also evidence of a complex culture, where the ancient humans probably used pigments symbolically — perhaps to paint themselves, or their hides, or weapons. And where different groups exchanged raw materials (and possibly food). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR toggle caption Jay Reed/NPR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There's that same kind of exchange today, says Brooks, referring to hunter gatherer groups like the Hadza people of northern Tanzania. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They deliberately maintain distant contacts with people in these other groups,\" she says. They have strategies to maintain these contacts — either by encouraging their children to marry into these other groups, or they take trips to visit the groups, to maintain ties by giving gifts. \"It's a way of building up these distant contacts, which are extremely important for their survival.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During times of stress, when food or water is scarce, people from one group can disperse and take shelter with other groups that they've cultivated a relationship with. \"So the networks are like money in the bank, or wheat in your silo or cows in your barn,\" says Brooks. \"They don't have any other way of saving for a rainy day.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And as she and her colleagues show, the beginning of the Middle Stone Age in Kenya was preceded by a long and tumultuous phase in the region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Things were going haywire, in terms of the development of geological faults, earthquake activity that moved the low places high and the high places low,\" says Potts. \"It changed the shape of the landscape.\" This was accompanied by repeated cycles of droughts and high rainfall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"And it is precisely during those time periods that we expect to see hunting and gathering people to move further distances,\" says Potts, \"and to begin to nurture relationships with groups beyond their own group.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is no different than what humans all over the world do today, he adds. When times are tough, we look for greener pastures. The archaeological records from the Middle Stone Age at Olorgesailie reveal \"the roots of that kind of migration,\" he says.\nPassage 4:\nJust 20 years ago, many archaeologists believed there was a “human revolution” 40,000-50,000 years ago during which modern behaviours such as symbolism, innovation and art suddenly arose. This was thought to have enabled a major shift in cognitive organisation and probably the advent of complex language. At the time, the earliest modern human fossils had been found in Africa and dated to some 100,000 years ago, leaving a gap between the emergence of anatomically modern humans and behaviourally modern humans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This gap in the development suggested that we only achieved “modernity” as our species migrated out of Africa and into the rest of the Old World. But this view is increasingly being challenged. Just weeks ago, we learned that Neanderthals could paint images. Now, three new papers, published in Science, show that technologically advanced behaviours occurred much earlier than we thought in the African stone age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not all researchers supported the view that modernity arose outside of Africa. Writing at the turn of the millennium, archaeologists Sally McBrearty and Allison Brooks complained that this view was Eurocentric and brought about by a profound under-appreciation of the depth and complexity of the African archaeological record. They argued that components of the “human revolution” were to be found in the African Middle Stone Age some 280,000-50,000 years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The role of climate change NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, two decades later, Brooks and her colleagues have presented well-dated evidence from the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya that places the evolution of some of these behaviours much further back in time. They highlight technological change at around 300,000 years ago that likely occurred in response to the effects of long-term, global environmental and climatic change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Human Origins Program, Smithsonian NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Around 800,000 years ago, the Olorgesailie Basin comprised a series of floodplains. Over the course of the next several hundred thousand years, the climate changed and the area developed into a vast arid grassland with massive turnover of prey mammal species as a consequence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This would have made life difficult for early humans in the region by making food sources unpredictable. Human populations needed to adapt or go extinct. The crux of these papers is that hominin populations did not disappear – so at least some of them must have adapted technologically and culturally, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering and sharing, and innovation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Based on excavations at five sites dating from 320,000 years ago, the team found distinct differences in the forms of stone tools compared to older deposits in the area – suggesting technological innovation had taken place. Older sites yielded large, bulky stone tools such as hand axes and cleavers. This technology is generally referred to as Acheulean (Early Stone Age). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In contrast, these sites at Olorgesailie contained much smaller, standardised pieces such as points and blades, some modified in a manner that made hafting possible. The team therefore classified them as Middle Stone Age industries. Many of the tools were made on obsidian (a volcanic glass) rather than rock. What’s more, chemical testing indictated that these raw materials came from 25-50 km away, and some from further afield. Some of these tools were made at the site and not brought in as finished items. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obsidian wasn’t the only exotic material – they also discovered bright red ochre pigment displaying evidence of grinding and cut marks, which makes this among the oldest known pigments used to colour rocks in the archaeological record. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Human Origins Program, Smithsonian NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Together, the glass and ochre mark the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the East African record. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gap in the evidence NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Across Africa, the Middle Stone Age is characterised by the absence or rarity of large cutting tools and the presence of prepared core technologies for making sophisticated points and blades. Crucially, the transition between the African Early and Middle Stone Age occurred around the time that our own species, Homo sapiens, was evolving across the continent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It might therefore be tempting to treat the appearance of the earliest Middle Stone Age technology as a cultural marker linked to the evolution and appearance of our own species – a smoking gun for evidence of the modern human mind. But it is probably too soon to jump to that conclusion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elsewhere across Africa, the association between Early and Middle Stone Age and pre- and fully-modern human fossils remains complex and confusing. Before 400,000 years ago, there are Early Stone Age sites which contain components such as blades and prepared cores. These are associated with archaic rather than modern human fossils such as at the Cave of Hearths. Conversely, we know that the production of Acheuelean large cutting tools by modern humans continued well into the period of the Middle Stone Age – such as at the 160,000-year-old site of Herto. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lee Berger et al/eLife Journal NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What is genuinely exciting about the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin is that we now know that one or more hominin groups were doing seemingly “modern” things at this critical time period. New tool forms and exotic materials require an understanding of space and time – bringing materials over great distances and passing on technological skills through successive generations. This suggests expanded social networks, transmission of information and technological innovation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rethinking the revolution NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It does seem that the “human revolution” that made us modern never was – archaeological evidence for modern behaviours arose much earlier, starting in groups that predated our own species. Every criterion that has historically been used to differentiate modern humans from archaic humans – culture, art, treatment of the dead, ornamentation and abstract symbolism – has much older examples. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What remains to be understood, however, is the relationship between complex behaviours and hominin species from 500,000 years to 160,000 years ago when many species of hominins (not just modern humans) inhabited the African landscape. Gradual complex change is more difficult to interpret than revolution.\n", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation.

And there’s absolutely no hope for the future,” my mother-in-law told me recently. “Everyone is frightened, we just don’t know where to turn.” She was, of course, referring to the great Irish economic meltdown, now firmly entrenched in its third year. Her tremulous voice was thick with the famous Irish doom and gloom, but there was truth in her words. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the ’90s and early ’00s, double-digit economic growth made Ireland the European Union’s poster child for success. Dublin exploded from a sleepy backwater to a city boasting some of the most expensive real estate in Europe. And then it all ended. To quote a friend, “The party’s over and the hangover is feckin’ brutal.” My own home in the city lost half its value, seemingly overnight. But Ireland is more than just Dublin, and out in the picture-postcard west, where the rising tide never raised all boats, rural life was, and remains, dependent on the harvest and livestock. And so I decided to head out and see just how the recession was weighing on the Irish spirit far from the city lights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Slideshow: Andrew McCarthy describes Doolin’s otherworldly landscape and music scene (Photos by Seamus Murphy) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I first arrived in Doolin, in County Clare, 25 years ago. A village of several hundred, strewn over a few miles on one main road, Doolin unfolds along a winding track that rises over a stone bridge, runs past two of the three pubs that anchor the town, dips into a swale, climbs over another bridge, works itself up a hill past a few shops and Gus O’Connor’s Pub, and then rolls down to the sea, where ferries ply the route to the Aran Islands. To the south, the coastline rises up into the Cliffs of Moher, 700 sheer feet of splendor above the Atlantic. Whitewashed houses with thatched roofs oversee sheep grazing across deep-green fields enclosed by crumbling stone walls that have stood for centuries. You can practically hear them singing “How are things in Glocca Morra?”—except that in Doolin, you’re more likely to catch the sounds of searing fiddles, rising flutes, and thumping bodhrán drums. The village has long been the epicenter of the traditional Irish music scene, and thanks largely to the success of Riverdance more than a decade ago, “trad” music is in the midst of a renaissance. On most every night, in any of Doolin’s three pubs, young musicians sit in, side by side with old, tearing into reels, jigs, and laments. The music may not have exempted Doolin from the recession, but it’s kept the place buzzing. “The people are still out and about, they’re just spending a lot less,” Orla McGovern tells me from behind the counter of her aptly named Traditional Music Shop on Fisher Street. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Late in the evening, I squeeze onto a stool at a packed McDermott’s Pub and recognize Geraldine MacGowan—one of Doolin’s local heroes and an international trad star—sitting in with the boys. She’s hard to miss, with her head of thick red hair and her wicked smile. She keeps time on the bodhrán and nods greetings to patrons as she plays. Eventually, she takes the microphone and sings a mournful ballad of loss and regret and fear. The locals nod with understanding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a break, Dolores Rice, a Dubliner down for the music and banter—the craic—explains, “Instilling fear is a Catholic tradition in Ireland. It’s something we’re very comfortable with. You can almost hear the priest say, ‘You thought you’d get away with your money grab, but the devil gets you in the end. You can’t sin without being punished.’” She looks around the crowded pub. “But we’re happy now, our most fatal certainty has been realized.” The Irish may have stopped going to church in large numbers, but it’s impossible to get the church out of the people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Outside, a light rain’s begun. I make my way over the stone bridge and past McGann’s Pub. The band inside is slashing into a reel, and I stand under the glow of the lone streetlamp, listening. The music burns to a crescendo and then breaks hard. There’s a moment of absolute silence in the countryside, and then it’s shattered as the crowd inside erupts. In Ireland, the day may have written checks the night can’t cash, but out here in Doolin, on this night at least, the credit’s still good.

He said better mental health care would help curb future shootings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Many states and many cities are closing their mental health facilities and closing them down, and they're closing them because they don't have the funding,\" he said. \"And we have to start looking much stronger into mental health.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While Trump warned that \"no matter what you do, you will always have problems,\" he argued that it doesn't make sense to limit access to firearms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's not the guns,\" Trump said during his hourlong speech. \"It's the people, it's these sick people.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also criticized President Barack Obama's comments in response to the shootings as \"divisive.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump's positions on gun control have evolved significantly over the years. While he now touts the National Rifle Association line, he once backed the ban on assault weapons and longer waiting periods for gun purchases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm a very, very big Second Amendment person,\" Trump said on Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump reminisced about Bronson's \"Death Wish\" and got people in the crowd to shout out the title of the 1974 film in unison.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today you can't make that movie because it's not politically correct,\" Trump said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Saturday marked the second time Trump had spoken in the Nashville area in five weeks.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He amplified the argument in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week, saying: “The gun laws have nothing to do with this. This is mental illness.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At a rally in suburban Nashville on Saturday, Trump mentioned his New York state handgun carry permit and added that anyone who attacked him would be “shocked”, because he would emulate Charles Bronson in the vigilante film Death Wish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m a very, very big second amendment person,” Trump said in Tennessee. “This is about self-defense, plain and simple.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump reminisced about the Bronson-starring 1974 film and got people in the crowd to shout out the title in unison.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump also defended his newly introduced tax plan, which independent economists estimate will cost $12tn over 10 years, by noting his ability to cut costs. He pointed to transportation as one place where he could save money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I look at the cost of a road where they’re gonna spend $600m building a simple road,” said Trump. “And I don’t mean I’m gonna save you a little bit.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm trying to help out the greatest living artist of our time while he's in need,\" Piatt told Mashable in an email. \"I saw that Kanye is 53 Million Dollars in debt and I knew I had to do anything I could to help, because as all my friends would tell you, I'm just a very giving person.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Piatt is modeling his act of good will and support of the arts after the wealthy Italian Medici family, who were known to financially support artists at the time of their reign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Kanye is the greatest living artist on the planet, he's told us many many many many times,\" Piatt told Mashable. \"The great artists need people to finance them, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo had the Medici family to fund their projects, so why not have the legions of Kanye fans fund his?

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Guardian wasn’t able to determine the true nature of West’s finances, but he does appear to have more than a few friends in Silicon Valley, based on public press accounts and interviews with several tech executives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He frequently shows up at Apple’s southern California office, is friends with rap-obsessed venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, has reportedly dined with an Instagram founder, and has some sort of social relationship with Dropbox chief executive Drew Houston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The interactions go back at least half a decade. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elon Musk (@elonmusk) Kanye stopped by the SpaceX rocket factory today. pic.twitter.com/6z7gHBn6 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There’s some context here. The entertainment industry and tech have long had a fascination with each other. For music titans such as West, Nas, MC Hammer and Justin Bieber, it’s become a way to grow serious businessperson bona fides. For technologists, it’s the ultimate revenge of the nerds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some of West’s early interactions with Silicon Valley were well-documented by Gawker’s tech industry gossip site Valleywag. In 2012 and 2013, the producer and rapper began pitching his latest vision, Donda, to investors. It was presented as a sort of hip man’s General Electric that would have its fingers in everything from fashion and publishing to “alternative energy sources” and “hovercrafts”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) Here is my Donda chart that I wrote 4 years ago that everyone laughed at… pic.twitter.com/g1po6Z3H55 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps trying to grease the levers of finance, West invited several tech thought leaders to his 2013 engagement party at San Francisco’s AT&T Park, home of the Giants. Horowitz, the cofounder of mega venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, was there, as was Dropbox’s Houston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another person present: Mahbod Moghadam, the controversial cofounder of Rap Genius, the Andreessen Horowitz-backed company that helps people understand rap lyrics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They’re tight. It’s cute,” Moghadam, who now works at Everipedia, said of Horowitz and West. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moghadam left Rap Genius in 2014 after comments he made about a mass shooting at the University of California Santa Barbara. “In their defense, I did do a lot of stupid things,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dropbox and Andreessen Horowitz didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It couldn’t be learned what relationship, if any, West maintains with executives at some of the biggest Silicon Valley companies, such as Facebook, Twitter, Uber and Alphabet (the artists formerly known as Google), although he has dined with Kevin Systrom, the cofounder of Facebook-owned Instagram. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But he does appear to have a working relationship with Apple, a less-than-surprising development given the iPhone maker’s work with streaming music these days – even if he did declare his new album The Life of Pablo would “never never never” be on Apple’s iTunes Store and would be exclusive to the streaming service Tidal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At Apple’s southern California headquarters, where former record executive Jimmy Iovine helps run Apple music, West is sometimes found hanging out in Iovine’s office, a person familiar with the meetings said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his Twitter posts on 14 February, West asked Zuckerberg for $1bn to help handle his debts and bring Donda, his startup idea, to fruition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Aaron Levie, the chief executive of Box, noted on Twitter, that’s a lot of money these days, even in Silicon Valley.\nPassage 5:\nStarting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

By Tuesday afternoon -- some 48 hours after West's desperate plea -- a total of $50 had been pledged to the multi-platinum hip-hop star. (That's 0.000094 percent of Kanye's total debt.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Piatt, a graphic designer, is no stranger to Internet fame. The 36-year-old, who made headlines last year for giving NFL helmets a bold makeover, said he was motivated by the desire to help a fellow artist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The arts must be funded, and without funding great ideas and great masterpieces never get made,\" Piatt said. \"This is a great way for people, not giant corporations, to support great artists and visionaries.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A West representative didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, Piatt wasn't alone in trying to organize support for Kanye. A separate GoFundMe campaign, called HELP PAY KANYE'S DEBT!, was organized by Robert Kulik in Washington, D.C. though it appears to have been canceled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A buck, five-spot, 10-banger, deuce-nil, Franklin...

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR West recently went on a bizarre Twitter rant in which he pleaded for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet CEO Larry Page to each invest $1 billion in his ideas. West tweeted Sunday that he feels rich people are always \"too cool\" to ask for help, including lending money. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some in Silicon Valley took note. Box CEO Aaron Levie tweeted: Classic Series A pitch deck line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yeezy -- that's one of West's nicknames -- also just released his latest album, \"The Life of Pablo,\" and debuted his latest clothing collection at Fashion Week in New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The album, which was released on the struggling music streaming app Tidal Sunday, was pulled down shortly after it appeared. The album has reportedly been illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times from other sites after many fans said they paid $20 to download the album off Tidal but didn't get it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On one of the tracks, West boasts he's responsible for pop star Taylor Swift's fame.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They say the signal has a frequency of 37.5kHz - the same as those emitted by the flight recorders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However there is no evidence so far that it is linked to MH370. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dozens of ships and planes have joined the search, with the operation moving into its most intensive phase before batteries on the data recorders fade. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Saturday the Haixun 01 - one of two Chinese ships in the area - picked up the signal at about 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude, the state-run Xinhua news agency said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Reuters Image caption Officials said there was \"some hope\" the locators would be able to find the black box NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The head of the Australian agency co-ordinating the search said the reported signals \"are consistent with the aircraft black box\" but \"there is no confirmation at this stage that the signals and the objects are related to the missing aircraft\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The flight is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, although no confirmed debris has been found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Analysis This could be potentially significant, but caution is necessary. There have been many apparently promising leads over the past few weeks that have looked like the search team closing in, only for those leads to turn into nothing. The tantalizing element is the frequency of the signal supposedly picked up. It is consistent with a black box pinger. But we know very little more about the nature of the contact. The Chinese ship is not among those that have been mentioned before as having special equipment to search for the black box pinger, but it is a very modern search-and-rescue vessel. Even with the sophisticated listening devices now being deployed in the search, the size of the search area, the range of the pinger signal, and the depths of water involved all mean it would need a lucky break at this stage to detect a signal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is still not known why the plane diverted from its planned flight path from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing four weeks ago with 239 people on board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Race against time NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two of the ships searching an area of about 217,000 sq km (84,000 sq miles) have underwater locator capabilities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Australian naval vessel Ocean Shield is using a \"towed pinger locator\" from the US Navy, while HMS Echo, which has similar capabilities, is also searching. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They are trying to detect an underwater signal emitted by the data recorders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The battery-powered signal fades after 30 days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The area - about 1,700km (1,000 miles) north-west of Perth - has been picked on the basis of analysis of the satellite data.

Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965. Courage is facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square or a machine gun nest on the beaches of Normandy.

It has eradicated the most successful, most widespread and best-sounding audio standard in the world in favor of its own proprietary system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A number of words come to mind to describe this. \"Hubris\" is one; \"arrogance\" is another. Given the amount of $9 aux-to-Lightning cable dongles Apple is likely to sell, you could use \"greed.\" Personally, I'd opt for \"stupidity.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So I can drop my iPhone 7 in the toilet, but I can't charge it and use headphones at the same time? #AppleEvent — Chris Taylor (@FutureBoy) September 7, 2016 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is in no way the equivalent of losing the CD drive or the 30-pin connector.

There's simply more audio information traveling over a wire than can travel over the air. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Say it with me now: wired almost always sounds better than wireless. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For years, I tried to convince myself otherwise. I've bought so many sets of Bluetooth headphones that my wife still laughs about it.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nSaddle up to the gate on your next United flight and you may notice that there's now a different system in place for loading passengers. Just this week, Chicago-based United Airlines updated its boarding process to rely on fewer boarding lanes, a move that will cut down on congestion and potentially speed up passenger loading. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new boarding process has been in the works for months. In June, United started experimenting with different boarding procedures in a handful of test gates in Chicago and Houston, two of the busiest hubs in the airline's network. Now, as of this week, the official new boarding process is finally in place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moving forward, the airline will still have five boarding groups but will only use two lanes for boarding. Elite and other priority passengers in group 1 and 2 will load through lane 1, while customers in group 3, 4 and 5 will use lane 2. Those not actively boarding will be asked to remain seated until paged. Chase co-branded credit card holders, according to the blog Wandering Aramean, will board in group 2. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the new boarding process, United is also launching push notifications for those who have the airline's mobile app. Those who opt in will be given a push notification when boarding starts, a tool that will be particularly useful if a flight is delayed or if the ground crew decides to load the aircraft early. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This week's updates come as the latest milestone in a long history of experimentation that United and other airlines have performed around the oft-complicated and congested boarding process. Several years ago, in an effort to better segment the cabin and speed up loading, United started using five lanes to feed through passengers. And while that method successfully segmented passengers in the boarding zone and prepared them for departure, it also created a fair amount of idle, standing passengers and congestion near the gate – especially during delays. The new strategy launched this week helps alleviate that problem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indeed, some of United's peers are already using this simplified process. American Airlines currently boards by zone using only two lanes while Delta Air Lines splits the difference and boards with four. One difference between United and its competitors, however, is that as of this week, top tier or \"1K\" elite members will be able to pre-board before the official process starts; with most carriers only VIP passengers are given that access. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New boarding lanes and gateside notifications should roll out to airports this week.\nPassage 2:\nCHICAGO, Nov. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- United Airlines today announced it has reached an agreement with Compañía Panameña de Aviación S.A. (Copa), Aerovías del Continente Americano S.A. (Avianca) and many of Avianca's affiliates, for a joint business agreement (JBA) that, pending government approval, is expected to provide substantial benefits for customers, communities and the marketplace for air travel between the United States and 19 countries in Central and South America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many more choices for customers NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By integrating their complementary route networks into a collaborative revenue-sharing JBA, United, Avianca and Copa plan to offer customers many benefits, including: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Integrated, seamless service in more than 12,000 city pairs NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New nonstop routes NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additional flights on existing routes NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reduced travel times NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Drive economic benefits for consumers and the communities we serve NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The carriers expect the JBA to drive significant traffic growth at major gateway cities coast to coast, which is expected to help bring new investment and create more economic development opportunities. Further, the JBA is expected to provide customers with expanded codeshare flight options, competitive fares, a more streamlined travel experience and better customer service, resulting in significant projected consumer benefits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Better serve our customers NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Additionally, allowing the three carriers to serve customers as if they were a single airline is expected to enable the companies to better align their frequent flyer programs, coordinate flight schedules and improve airport facilities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This agreement represents the next chapter in U.S.-Latin American air travel,\" said Scott Kirby, United's president. \"We are excited to work with our Star Alliance partners Avianca and Copa to bring much-needed competition and growth to many underserved markets while providing a better overall experience for business and leisure customers traveling across the Western Hemisphere.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are delighted to further solidify our existing partnership with United Airlines and look forward to increasing service options for our customers by working more closely with Avianca,\" said Pedro Heilbron, Copa Airlines' chief executive officer. \"We believe this agreement benefits our passengers by providing competitive fares and a superior network of more than 275 destinations throughout Latin America and the U.S., and promotes further growth and innovation within the airline industry in the Americas.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are certain that together we are stronger in the United States – Latin America market than any of the three airlines individually,\" said Hernan Rincon, Avianca's executive president – chief executive officer. \"This partnership will allow Avianca to strengthen its position as a first-level player in the airline industry in America as we will expand our scope in the continent with United and Copa, offering better connectivity to our customers.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JBAs drive competition that benefits customers NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although JBAs have been proven around the world to benefit consumers and enhance competition, currently 99 percent of the U.S. carrier passenger traffic that makes connections in Central and South America does so without a JBA. Competition in the U.S.-Latin American market has grown and includes a diverse set of carriers offering service across multiple price points. Yet the market lacks a comprehensive revenue-sharing, metal-neutral network of carriers and the associated heightened competitive forces that drive value and better consumer experiences. The JBA represents an innovative, best-in-class new product offering that will make competition in this robust market even stronger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Our analysis shows that a metal-neutral JBA among United, Copa and Avianca will provide substantial benefits to consumers traveling between the relevant countries,\" said Dr. Darin Lee, executive vice president of economic consulting firm Compass Lexecon and airline industry expert. \"This JBA will enable United, Copa and Avianca to compete more effectively, offer competitive fares, and increase service, encouraging innovation and establishing a more robust and vibrant marketplace.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To enable the deep coordination required to deliver these benefits to consumers, communities and the marketplace, United, Copa and Avianca plan to apply in the near term for regulatory approval of the JBA and an accompanying grant of antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation and other regulatory agencies. The parties do not plan on fully implementing the JBA until they receive the necessary government approvals. The JBA currently includes cooperation between the U.S. and Central and South America, excluding Brazil. With the recently concluded Open Skies agreement between the U.S. and Brazil, the carriers are exploring the possibility of adding Brazil to the JBA.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR United Airlines says its customers have complained about clusters of travelers around its gates. Travelers spilled into corridors and arriving passengers who just stepped off a flight were met with hordes of departing travelers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's too congested,\" said Maria Walter, United Airlines' managing director of global operations strategy. \"It created a lot of angst from our customers.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The airline on Tuesday debuted a new boarding process in an effort to combat this passenger pain point, and make sure flights depart on time as more travelers than ever opt to fly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR United reduced the boarding lines to two from five, and is urging travelers to wait until their boarding group — numbered 1 through 5 — is called. United carried close to 155 million passengers in the 12 months ended in August, up 6.1 percent from the year-earlier period, the company said last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The airline now sends out notifications to passengers on their mobile devices to let them now boarding has begun once the first boarding pass is scanned, so that travelers don't have to hover around the gate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Travelers would sometimes queue up an hour before a flight, Walter said, which would attract even more passengers to the line. \"It's like a magnet,\" she said.\nPassage 4:\nDon't crowd the gate: United rolls out a new boarding process NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CLOSE United says it’s streamlining its boarding process. Gone are the five boarding lines used in the previous process. It is a new two-lane, color-coded process that will handle a staggered boarding call. USA TODAY NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR United has become the latest airline to tweak the way it calls passengers to board its planes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a change that’s rolling out to United gates nationwide on Tuesday, the carrier says it’s streamlining its boarding process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With that, United joins American and Delta in making changes to the boarding call since early 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TODAY IN THE SKY: 'Nobody is winning' the airline boarding nightmare NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At United, gone are the five boarding lines used in the previous process. In is a new two-lane, color-coded process that will handle a staggered boarding call. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lanes will be numbered “1” and “2.” Beyond that, lane 1 is the “blue” lane while lane 2 is “green.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When it’s time to board, United will call pre-boarding that's open to its top-tier “Premier 1K” and “Global Services” frequent-flyers, active military, customers with disabilities and families with children ages 2 and younger. They'll board via lane 1. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This graphic provided by United attempts to explain its new boarding process. (Photo: United Airlines) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next comes Group 1, which includes first- and business-class customers plus Platinum- and Gold-level frequent-flyers. Group 1 also boards through lane 1, while Group 2 lines up in lane 2. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Group 2 boards once the Group 1 queue clears. Who is in Group 2? Silver-level frequent-fliers and certain United credit-card holders and customers who’ve purchased United’s priority access or boarding privileges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Travelers in Groups 3, 4 and 5 will be asked to remain seated while the first two groups line up and board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Group 1 and Group 2 have boarded, Groups 3 through 5 will board through the green-colored Lane 2. They’ll be called by number, starting with 3 and ending at 5. Group 5 will include most Basic Economy customers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Members of Group 1 and 2 who are still arriving to the gate area will priority board via the blue-colored Lane 1. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR United says it’s implementing the boarding change after “testing a variety of boarding concepts” since last fall. The new system has been in affect at Los Angeles International Airport since February and will now roll out to all United locations beginning Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR United’s changes hint at the struggle airlines have had in creating a boarding process that doesn't stress out customers. Even with precisely delineated groups and queues, many travelers still feel compelled to stand in line to hold their spot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both American and Delta rolled out similar changes in early 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Southwest, of course, has its own type of system since it has no assigned seats. It calls for fliers in its “A” group to line up at their corresponding pillars, which display numbers indicating where passengers should stand. As the “A” group boards, Southwest repeats the process for the “B” and “C” groups until all passengers have boarded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That system, enacted in 2007, was meant to address crowding in the gate areas as customers queued up to be first on the plane. The move didn’t eliminate pre-boarding line-ups, but it did add order to the process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Airlines now have so many different tiers of boarding groups, between their different levels of elite-status members and their co-branded credit card customers and others,\" Henry Harteveldt, an airline analyst and founder of San Francisco-based Atmosphere Research, told USA TODAY's Today in the Sky blog at the time. “The result is frustration, crowding, unpleasantness and stress. Nobody is winning here.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TODAY IN THE SKY: Would you bid 420,000 miles to see a parked plane? These frequent-fliers did (story continues below) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR United said customer feedback helped push it to come up with a new system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,” Sarah Murphy, United’s vice president of Global Operations Strategy, Planning and Design, said in a statement. “We listened to customers and employees as we tested a variety of processes on thousands of flights until we found a better boarding process that results in less time spent waiting in lines, improved communication and a better way to recognize our Premier customers while balancing out the number of passengers in each boarding group.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One big challenge that could remain for United is how its elite-level frequent-flyers will sort themselves out in the updated process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When a large number of United’s elite customers are flying on a single flight, it's been a frequent complaint in recent years that it would seem as though half the plane (or more) boarded in the first two groups. Whether elite customers now filter more evenly into the updated boarding groups on such flights remains to be seen.

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

Martin Luther King Jr. was postponed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Organizers said the event will be rescheduled for September or October. The memorial, the first on the Mall honoring an African American, has been a quarter-century in the making, but safety trumped ceremony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hurricane Irene was forecast to sweep over the Outer Banks of North Carolina overnight Friday and advance into the Washington area with a vanguard of showers beginning Saturday afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early Friday morning, the National Weather Service upgraded the Tropical Storm Watch issued for much of the D.C. area to a Tropical Storm Warning.

We will move forward as a police department, city, and community, together.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Broward Sheriff’s Office gave this account of Johnson’s arrest: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Friday, Johnson used his cellphone to call a number he’d found on the escort section of backpage.com and spoke to a woman he believed to be a prostitute. They discussed him paying $80 for 30 minutes with one woman, later settling on $100 for a threesome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At about 6:20 p.m. Friday, Johnson arrived at an unidentified hotel in Dania Beach with two condoms in his back pocket. He knocked on the door of room 423, where he was greeted by the presumed prostitutes. As soon as he paid the $100, he was arrested. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Detectives captured the encounter with Johnson on video and audio.

Then the city released this statement: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We remain committed to excellence and integrity on every level. We will not allow Mr. Johnson’s bad judgment to reflect negatively on the hardworking officers of the city of Miami Gardens and the residents they serve on a daily basis.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The expectations had been high for Johnson, a veteran cop. He’d come with 30 years of experience working in the public sector. Rising from a rookie cop to police chief in North Miami during the first 27 years, he then transitioned to the city’s administration when he was appointed interim city manager in August 2011. Within three months, he was given the permanent job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By spring 2014, city administrators in Miami Gardens were looking for a new top cop after losing former chief Matthew Boyd — the young city’s first and only police chief at the time — and his deputy chief Paul Miller when they resigned amid allegations of harassment and illegal stop-and-frisk tactics at the 207 Quikstop. The scandal, brought to light after the Miami Herald obtained surveillance videos from the convenience store owners showing cops’ behavior, left a blemish on the department’s reputation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In April 2014, Johnson donned the four gold stars on his collar for Miami Gardens as he set out to improve the reputation of the police department.

He was criticized for buying 43 replica police badges for former North Miami Mayor Andre Pierre without consulting the city manager. According to evaluations from his time on the North Miami force, he was noted for submitting police reports late and writing correspondence with grammatical errors.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nAs Detroit’s water provider continues to carry out its plan to turn off the taps for tens of thousands of nonpaying customers across the city, activists are resorting to civil disobedience in an attempt to stop what they call a human rights violation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some 50 demonstrators on Thursday held a protest outside the offices of Homrich, a company contracted by the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) to stop the flow to residences at least two months past due on their accounts. At least nine of the activists were arrested by Detroit police and charged with disorderly conduct when they temporarily blocked trucks from leaving the company’s parking lot. They were released on bail hours later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the protest was relatively small, activists say it’s a sign of things to come if DWSD continues shutting off water lines. The activists say that in a city with a poverty rate of 44 percent, and where water bills are higher than in much of the country, Detroit should work out a solution with poor residents instead of leaving them dry. Otherwise, they say, they’ll have no other choice but to take to the streets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I warned the water department that if they did not immediately stop the shutoffs, these things will take place,” said Demeeko Williams, an activist with the Detroit Water Brigade. “People are mad. This is the first resistance, and there will be more.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Critics say that DWSD has been unnecessarily aggressive in pursuing delinquent accounts since it began ramping up shutoffs in April. Williams said the department has shut off accounts of families with young children, as well as houses with the disabled and elderly residents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The water department says it needs to shut off the water to recoup some $175 million in outstanding bills. But DWSD has also been accused of ignoring the debts of large entities — like a golf course that owes $437,000 and the state of Michigan itself, which owes $70,000 — while going after people who owe as little as $150 on their accounts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DWSD says there are sufficient payment plans and assistance programs in place to help those who fall behind on their bills. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But nearly 50 percent of DWSD’s accounts are behind on payments, according to the department, and Detroit’s already-high water prices are on the rise, now averaging $75 a household — almost double the national average. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Activists say those high numbers give residents no choice but to protest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month, Detroit activists successfully petitioned a U.N. panel to call the water shutoffs a violation of human rights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The households which suffered unjustified disconnections must be immediately reconnected,” the U.N. experts said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this week, a group from Windsor, Ontario, crossed the border to deliver 1,000 liters of water in a display of support for Detroit residents. And protests have been held outside DWSD’s offices every Friday since the shutoffs began. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The pressure seems to be partially working: DWSD announced a $1 million fund on Tuesday for residents struggling to pay. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But even with the $1 million, activists say many others are likely to lose access to water over the summer. If the shutoffs continue, they say, DWSD can expect larger protests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We didn’t come out here as a symbolic gesture. This is serious. This is direct action, and it’s only the beginning,” said Elena Herrada, a Detroit school board member and candidate for the Michigan House of Representatives who was arrested during the protest on Thursday. “Nobody is coming to save us. This is what we have to do.”\nPassage 2:\nLATEST HEADLINES NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Georgea Kovanis: Yup, back to school shopping — already The Nordstrom Anniversary Sale ends Sunday. .

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Darryl Latimer, deputy director, said shut-off crews are now mobilizing to go out and cut service to delinquent commercial customers, which make up about 12% of the approximately 90,000 accounts that are at least 60 days past due. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, the DWSD has been shutting off water service aggressively for its delinquent residential customers. Latimer said the department executed 7,210 shut-offs in June. Combined, shut-offs in April and May totaled 7,556. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ■ Related: Nearly $1 million available for Detroit water customers who've received shut-off notices NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ■ Related: Emergency water supplies on tap for Detroiters faced with shutoffs NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Activists who have protested the shut-offs as an affront to human rights have for weeks criticized the water department for ignoring commercial deadbeats. In response, water officials steadfastly maintained that their collection efforts, which began in March, included commercial properties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the department’s contractor to help carry out the shut-offs is equipped to handle only residential properties. The department had to make arrangements for its own employees to cut off service for commercial customers, Latimer said, adding that the recipients of the 46,000 shut-off notices sent out in May included commercial properties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Some of those (commercial) customers probably have gotten shut-off notices. We just haven’t moved to shut them off. The contractor couldn’t shut them off,” Latimer said Wednesday. “They’re not equipped to shut off a larger industry like a Ford Field or what have you.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The department released a list of 40 commercial and industrial accounts with the highest delinquent balances. In addition to mailings, the department is physically posting shut-off notices on those buildings in case they house rentals for apartments or office spaces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vargo Golf, which owns Palmer Park Golf Course and Chandler Park Golf Course, tops the list, with a delinquent account balance of $437,714. Another Vargo Golf account for a separate property has a delinquent balance of $100,528. The list, available at freep.com, includes an account for the State of Michigan, which owes $70,246. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A message was left with Vargo Golf seeking comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The list of delinquent commercial customers did not include Ford Field, the Detroit Lions or Olympia Entertainment, the Ilitch-owned company that leases the Joe Louis Arena. Activists protesting the water department shut-offs have claimed the operators of Joe Louis are let off the hook despite outstanding water bills. Latimer said Olympia Entertainment, which operates Joe Louis Arena, recently sent some checks for water payment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The water department’s shut-off campaign — which has coincided with Detroit’s landmark bankruptcy case — has drawn international attention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Water officials say shut-offs happened in past years, but the collection efforts intensified this year because the delinquent debt in Detroit forces higher rates for the city’s paying customers. An 8.7% rate hike took effect this month, increasing the average Detroiter’s bill from $65 to $70. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ann Rall, a founding member of the Detroit People’s Water Board and a volunteer with the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization, said the water department is unfairly targeting residents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Everybody who is involved in the struggle to the human right to water does point out that its inequitable to be picking on the least powerful people and only now going after the corporate accounts,” Rall said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A coalition of welfare rights organizations appealed to the United Nations to have service restored to customers and to prevent more shutoffs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Latimer said he has not had any interactions with the United Nations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He addressed the notion that water is a human right while stressing that the DWSD has to pay for water delivery and is a nonprofit enterprise. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think that water may be a human rights issue. That’s not our issue,” Latimer said. “Water is a human right. But delivering to your home, purified. Who pays for that?”\nPassage 4:\nDETROIT, MI -- Detroit police on Thursday arrested eight people, including religious leaders, who were protesting controversial water shutoffs for overdue bills in Detroit, Officer LaShawn Peoples of the Public Information Office confirms.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An official with the Russian Embassy said Katriuk’s death makes it impossible, “unfortunately,” for him to face justice. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Sadly, the Canadian government ignored numerous appeals by Canadian Jewish organizations and efforts by the Russian authorities to ensure that justice be served, allowing Vladimir Katriuk to retain citizenship of Canada while peacefully residing in this country,” press secretary Kirill Kalinin said in an email sent to The Canadian Press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Employing legal or politically motivated loopholes to evade from trying or extraditing Nazi war criminals is totally unacceptable.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russia’s intervention in Ukraine has led to Canada all but severing relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as imposing a slew of sanctions against individuals and entities in both countries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Federal Court ruled in 1999 that Katriuk lied about his voluntary service for German authorities during the war in order to obtain Canadian citizenship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The court concluded Katriuk had been a member of a Ukrainian battalion implicated in numerous atrocities in Ukraine — including the deaths of thousands of Jews in Byelorussia between 1941 and 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in 2007 the Canadian government overturned an earlier decision to revoke Katriuk’s citizenship, due to a lack of evidence.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The article said a man with Katriuk’s name lay in wait in March 1943 outside a barn that had been set ablaze, operating a machine-gun and firing on civilians as they tried to flee the burning building. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The same document said the man took a watch, bracelet and gun from the body of a woman found nearby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “One witness stated that Volodymyr Katriuk was a particularly active participant in the atrocity: he reportedly lay behind the stationary machine-gun, firing rounds on anyone attempting to escape the flames,” said the article, authored by Lund University historian Per Anders Rudling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rudling, whose research was published in the spring 2012 issue of Holocaust Genocide Studies, attributed these details to KGB interrogations released for the first time in 2008.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Chimerix pharmaceutical company said Tuesday that the ailing 7-year-old will receive medicine that doctors hope will help him when he becomes the first patient in a new trial set to start Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Todd Hardy, Josh's father, said he got the call from Chimerix president Kenneth Moch about a half hour before the public announcement was made. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was wonderful,\" Hardy said. \"Truly wonderful. It was overwhelming.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an emotional Facebook post, mother Aimee Hardy praised the company's decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Glory to GOD!\" she wrote. \"They are releasing the drug for Josh!!!!!!!!!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company had previously denied calls from the 7-year-old's family to give him the drug, brincidofovir, arguing that spending the time to help Josh and others like him would slow down efforts to get the drug on the market. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Josh's story drew national attention as his parents and supporters pushed the company to change its mind in online and media campaigns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CNN told Josh's story Sunday night, describing his parents' desperate pleas for help from Chimerix. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Josh's journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now he's in critical condition in an intensive care unit as the virus ravages his body. Josh is in heart and kidney failure. He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His doctors at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis had also been pushing for the company to provide the drug. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement Tuesday, the hospital said it expected to receive the medication within 48 hours, but noted that its safety and effectiveness has not yet been established for use in children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation,\" the hospital said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"St. Jude will continue to pursue state-of-the-art treatment for Josh and all of our patients. We are grateful for the efforts of Chimerix, the FDA and many others who worked to achieve this outcome. We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An FDA policy known as \"compassionate use\" allows someone with a serious or life-threatening disease to ask a drug company for an experimental drug. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though it's called compassionate use, sometimes it feels anything but compassionate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies often say yes: The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as Chimerix did at first to Josh Hardy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moch previously told CNN he wouldn't back down from his decision not to give Josh the drug. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said Tuesday that he hopes the new FDA-approved study will help other patients as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm happy for Josh and I'm happy for many patients,\" Moch said. \"We've come up with a way of helping not just Josh, but helping other patients in need, and there are many.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the past two years, the company has received more than 80 requests for compassionate use of brincidofovir from patients like Hardy, according to Moch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Todd Hardy hailed Moch as a hero. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He's a super man. He worked diligently on behalf of everybody,\" Hardy said. \"His integrity was unquestioned. He was utterly professional.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Facebook page dedicated to the online campaign to help Josh get the medicine posted a thank-you message to supporters Tuesday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Thank you to every member of Josh's Army.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drug company, Chimerix, said Tuesday it worked out a deal with the Food and Drug Administration for a clinical trial of the drug, and Josh will be the first recipient. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the young cancer victim underwent a recent bone-marrow transplant, there were complications and his health deteriorated. He developed an adenovirus, and the only drug that his family believes would help save his life is not yet widely available. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It lacks FDA approval and Chimerix was initially unable to supply Josh with the medication. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Chimerix worked with the FDA to expedite additional trials. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We have been working aggressively and intimately with the FDA for a long period of time,” Kenneth Moch, the president and CEO of Chimerix, said in a telephone interview with The Free Lance–Star on Tuesday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Josh’s family reacted on social media, where Josh’s story spread widely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Glory to GOD. They are releasing the drug to Josh!!!!!” wrote Aimee Hardy, Josh’s mom, on her Facebook page. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Josh’s story brought public attention to the impact of an adenovirus infection and the need for additional clinical development to assess the drug’s potential. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They helped bring forth a discussion” Moch said of the Hardy family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company had been in talks with the FDA, but could not reveal that because it did not want to get hopes up, Moch said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We had to figure out a way to make it available to many people in need,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brincindofovir will be released to 20 patients in an open-label study, beginning today with Josh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The FDA has committed to work expeditiously with Chimerix on the design of a pivotal Phase 3 study that would be a continuation of this pilot study, according to a press release from Chimerix. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drug was on its way to Memphis on Tuesday night and could be administered to Josh Wednesday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A campaign through social media had erupted to flood Chimerix with phone calls and emails urging the company to change its mind about giving Josh a dose of the medicine he needs. Josh’s story has attracted national attention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Family members have appeared on national television, including shows on CNN and Fox News, throughout the week to plead Josh’s case to Chimerix. Family members were scheduled to appear Wednesday morning on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” It wasn’t clear Tuesday evening whether that appearance was still scheduled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moch said in the interview that social media can be good, like the support that erupted for the Hardy family. But it also can be bad—like death threats to Moch and other employees of Chimerix. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Facebook page set up to support Josh, called “Save Josh” attracted more than 15,000 fans. Thousands of tweets were sent to Chimerix’s Twitter handle, with #savejosh. Online petitions were set up on whitehouse.gov and change.org that attracted thousands of signatures in support of Josh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the Facebook page, part of the message posted after the good news came said, “You did it. You Saved Josh. Thanks you Chimerix and Josh’s Army.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Local organizations, including Foode, Old Towne Butcher, The Fairy Godmother Project and charities around the country joined to support the Hardy family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Foode offered “Joshburgers” Tuesday in exchange for people signing letters to send to Moch. More than 500 people signed letters.

(Photo: Jordan Strauss, Invision/AP) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another week, another ugly allegation of sexual assault against a Hollywood star, this time tough-guy actor Tom Sizemore who is accused of sexually molesting an 11-year-old actress on a movie set in 2003. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Hollywood Reporter posted a story late Monday recounting how Sizemore, then 42, allegedly was told to leave the Utah set of a crime thriller called Born Killers (shot as Piggy Banks) after the child actress told her mother that Sizemore had touched her genitals during a photo shoot for the film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But her parents declined to press charges and months later, Sizemore returned for reshoots in Malibu. THR said the story was based on interviews with a dozen people involved with the production who confirmed that Sizemore was sent home over the alleged incident, and that it provoked anger and tensions on the set. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sizemore, 55, already notorious in Hollywood for his drug use and convictions for battery against women, has never been accused of molestation before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is best known for his roles in action films and dramas, especially Saving Private Ryan in 1998 and Black Hawk Down and Pearl Harbor in 2001. Despite his rap sheet, he has worked steadily; his IMDb page lists 15 projects in 2018 alone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This incident has previously gone unreported, THR reported, but is coming out now in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment-and-rape scandal, which has set off a cascade of similar allegations and a belated industry move towards openness about such accusations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR USA TODAY reached out to Sizemore's representatives but has received no response. His agent, Stephen Rice, told the industry trade paper, \"Our position is 'no comment.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charles Lago of DTLA Entertainment Group, who was Sizemore's former manager for a half-dozen years until Lago dropped him in disgust after he was accused of beating women, said he was \"not surprised\" by the allegation. He blamed Sizemore's behavior on frequent drug use. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He's the most abhorrent person I've ever met in my life,\" Lago said, although this alleged incident happened before he worked with Sizemore. \"I heard something happened on the set but I didn't realize it involved a child. It was hushed up.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The young actress, now 26, was unidentified at her request; she told THR she didn't want to talk about the matter except to say that she's recently hired a lawyer to explore legal action against the actor as well as her parents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR THR reported Sizemore is said to have denied the young actress' claim as soon as he was confronted with it; shortly after, he was quietly dropped by his management firm and talent agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The promotional photo session required the child, who had a small role in the film, to be seated on Sizemore's lap for a holiday picture. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is when Sizemore allegedly either rubbed his finger against the girl's vagina or inserted it inside,\" THR reported. The paper quoted production manager Cassidy Lunnen recalling that the \"the girl was so young it was unclear to her and (later) her parents what had actually taken place and if it was intentional or not.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The paper also interviewed Robyn Adamson, who portrayed the wife in the film, who stood near the photographer when the picture was being taken. She recalled the child, who was wearing a flannel nightgown, reacted to something during the photoshoot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited,\" Adamson told the paper. \"I was watching her. She soon reintegrated and kept going, although she had trouble taking direction. Later, when I was told about what happened, I knew exactly what it was.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When casting director Catrine McGregor heard about the alleged encounter from the child's agent, she filed a complaint with the Screen Actors Guild legal department and pushed for Sizemore's immediate dismissal from the project. (SAG declined to comment to THR.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The paper also talked to a production assistant, Roi Maufas, who said the crew believed what the child said because they considered Sizemore a \"sleazebag.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There was never any doubt,\" Maufas said. \"He was this guy who was already known for making inappropriate comments, being drunk, being high. We're talking about consistent behavior, just being 'Tom Sizemore' on set every day. Then this happens. Guys reached for hammers.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The producers of the film told THR they removed Sizemore from the set as soon as they heard about the assertion, reviewed the photographs from the portrait session but found them to be inconclusive, and suggested to the child's parents they could contact police if they wanted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They did talk to the police but didn't press charges,\" producer Michael Manshel told the paper. \"We also talked to Tom at the time, and told him everything that had been told to us, and he said: 'I've done a lot of awful things, and I'd never do anything with kids.'

Months later, he returned for reshoots in Malibu after her parents declined to press charges. The incident has never been revealed publicly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When contacted, the now 26-year-old former actress, whom THR is not identifying at her request, declined to address the matter except to note that she's recently hired a lawyer to explore legal action against the actor as well as her parents.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR THR spoke to a dozen people involved with the production of the film, a crime thriller called Born Killers (shot as Piggy Banks). They confirmed Sizemore was sent home over the alleged incident. According to these cast- and crewmembers, rumors swirled and emotions rose on set over what had allegedly transpired. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sizemore, notorious for his long rap sheet that includes charges of drug use and battery against women, has not previously been accused of molestation. An actor with a tough-guy image then at the height of his scandal-driven infamy, when the Utah incident occurred he'd recently been convicted of physically abusing and harassing his ex-girlfriend, the former \"Hollywood Madam\" Heidi Fleiss. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sizemore is said to have denied the young actress' claim as soon as he was confronted with it. His management firm Untitled and talent agency CAA quietly dropped him shortly afterward. He's currently repped by the boutique firm Pantheon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ​Cast- and crewmembers, inspired by the nascent movement toward industry transparency in the post-Harvey Weinstein era, explain that the incident took place near the end of production on Born Killers (not to be confused with Oliver Stone's earlier Natural Born Killers, which Sizemore also appeared in). It was during a second-unit still portrait session, to capture photos of Sizemore's character with his abandoned wife and daughter. The imagery would serve as a plot device in the $5 million film, which was released by Lionsgate in 2005. The film centers on two immoral brothers on a crime spree. (Sizemore played the dissolute father who raised them.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ​The roughly half-hour session required the young actress, who had a small role in the production, to be seated on Sizemore's lap in a holiday tableau. This is when Sizemore allegedly either rubbed his finger against the girl's vagina or inserted it inside. Production manager Cassidy Lunnen recalls that \"the girl was so young it was unclear to her and [later] her parents what had actually taken place and if it was intentional or not.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During one setup, which required just the two of them, Robyn Adamson, who portrayed the wife, stood away, near the photographer. She recalls of the girl, who was wearing a flannel nightgown: \"At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited. I was watching her. She soon reintegrated and kept going, although she had trouble taking direction. Later, when I was told about what happened, I knew exactly what it was.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Catrine McGregor, the casting director who hired the young actress, fielded a call from the actress' agent the next day, explaining that the girl had informed her mother that she'd been inappropriately touched. \"The mother noticed that her daughter was unusually quiet and told her she was going to take her to this swimming place that was the little girl's favorite thing,\" says McGregor, a four-decade veteran in the business, who notes that she subsequently filed a complaint with SAG's legal department and advocated for Sizemore's immediate dismissal from the project. (SAG declined to comment.) \"When the girl put on her bathing suit, she told her mother that it reminded her of the day before, in an upsetting way — that the bathing suit's contact against her felt like what happened when the man had put his finger inside her,\" as McGregor understood the events on-set. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Word spread quickly. \"It filtered down to the crew,\" says Roi Maufas, who worked as a production assistant. \"The little girl said what she said and we all thought, 'That fucking sleazebag.' There was never any doubt. He was this guy who was already known for making inappropriate comments, being drunk, being high. We're talking about consistent behavior, just being 'Tom Sizemore' on set every day. Then this happens. Guys reached for hammers. [Producer James R. Rosenthal, who died in 2011], who was livid himself, had to stop a group of us from going to visit Mr. Sizemore to kick the guy's ass.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In interviews, the film's producers Jai Stefan, Michael Manshel and Gus Spoliansky note that they removed Sizemore from set as soon as they heard about the assertion, reviewed the photographs from the portrait session but found them to be inconclusive evidence and sought out the parents to encourage them to engage law enforcement if they felt compelled to do so. Stefan, who along with the others describes being heavily affected by the actress' claim (\"I was like, 'Did that just happen on my watch?' I started crying\"), recalls the parents \"not wanting the little girl being taken off the movie. We said we can remove her, remove him, remove both.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They did talk to the police but didn't press charges,\" says Manshel adding: \"We also talked to Tom at the time, and told him everything that had been told to us, and he said: 'I've done a lot of awful things, and I'd never do anything with kids.' We considered whether we had some responsibility to him to not pass judgment on him.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Eventually, in need of pick-up shots, they invited Sizemore to Spoliansky's Malibu home a couple of months later for reshoots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We had a fiduciary responsibility to complete the film so we decided to go about business as usual — lacking the evidence of what happened that day,\" says Spoliansky. Still, he's quick to add, \"We took the allegation extremely seriously and we were willing to do anything, including dismissing Tom. We just couldn't be police, judge and jury.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McGregor, the first to come forward to THR about the episode, speculates that the girl's parents may not have wanted to compound professional harm with emotional harm, observing that they \"didn't want to possibly ruin their daughter's film career.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ​Sizemore, 55, gained renown in the 1990s for a series of tough-guy supporting roles in primarily action films and dramas, including Point Break, True Romance, Strange Days and Wyatt Earp, leading to his biggest career moments with Saving Private Ryan in 1998 and Black Hawk Down and Pearl Harbor in 2001. (In 2000 he was nominated for a Golden Globe for his acting in the HBO movie Witness Protection.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ​After the Born Killers shoot, and in the midst of becoming a father (to twin boys in 2005), Sizemore continued to work steadily, although relegated to smaller roles on less prestigious projects. More recently, though, his career has picked up again, particularly on TV, with notable arcs on USA's Shooter and Showtime's revival of Twin Peaks. In September, he appeared opposite Liam Neeson in Felt, playing an FBI rival of the Deep Throat source in the Watergate drama. At press time, according to IMDb, he's attached to, and frequently listed as starring in, more than three dozen often low-budget and genre independent film projects in some stage of development or production. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sizemore has long publicly contended with a drug addiction that dates to his teens. (Among other troubles, Bakersfield police charged him with possession of methamphetamine in 2007, and three years later he appeared on Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew.) He also has a history of alleged aggressive behavior toward women, most recently in February, pleading no contest to two misdemeanor charges of domestic abuse for assaulting his girlfriend in July 2016 in downtown L.A. This followed two previous arrests for suspected battery of another woman in 2009 and 2011, and before that his Fleiss conviction in Los Angeles court in August 2003 — the same month that production began on Born Killers.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Infamous classroom legend NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There evidently is a very thin line between love and hate,\" Hooper said during an hourlong interview at her home last week. Cruz, who lives in San Antonio, was in West Texas visiting family for the Fourth of July weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's a long, emotional story of how teacher and pupil became mother and son, and one they chose to tell for the first time in almost 35 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What had happened was for like about five years before I got him, I was warned, 'You don't want that child,' because he was really a holy terror,\" Hooper, 68, said. \"He had a reputation, and he intended to live up to it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sometimes Cruz misbehaved, using his still-prevalent sense of dry humor to distract the class from the teacher's lesson. Other times, he threw chairs or stabbed his peers. His academic standing made for an extra challenge. He had dyslexia and was two grade levels behind in reading, so he was considered a special education student. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the time Cruz reached sixth grade, he had become a Brown NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elementary legend. His notorious antics led Hooper to tell her principal, \"If you put that Riojas kid in my class, I'm going to quit.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though she never made good on that promise, Hooper said she wasn't joking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I really had hoped that he'd be put in another person's room, but at that time I was the only one who could really handle the hard discipline problems,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Total squalor' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz, now 45, said when he was growing up he did anything to get attention. The violence stemmed from a constant need to defend himself at home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During his sixth-grade year with the woman he once called Mrs. Hooper, Cruz's biological mother was on husband No. 5 - an abusive, tyrannical man Cruz doesn't like to talk about. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz, his four half-siblings, their mother and \"No. 5\" lived in a one-room lean-to on a turnrow in the middle of a field. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He wore the same green pants and striped shirt to school every day, Hooper remembers, and the only shoes he had to wear were his sister's. He and his siblings were sent home with lice 12 times that year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was total squalor,\" Hooper said. \"I would not let my animals live the way they had to live.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz described it this way: \"We slept on the floor and ate ----.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's all one needs to know to understand the situation, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Change of heart NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In December of that school year, Cruz changed, Hooper said. He starting asking if he could help around the classroom, and it wasn't long before Hooper and her husband, Gale, hired him to do odd jobs at their home and rental properties for cash - money his stepfather didn't let him keep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As a healthier relationship developed between Cruz and his teacher, the Hoopers' home became a refuge for the troubled student. Whenever he and No. 5 fought, Cruz ran 7.5 miles from his house to theirs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His home life worsened as he entered seventh grade at Atkins Junior High School. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One cold, snowy day in February 1983, Cruz had the last fight he would have with his stepfather - one in which he told the man in no uncertain terms he would beat him up when he got older. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No. 5 kicked him out. He was 12. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz's mom packed everything he owned in a cardboard box, called Hooper and took her son to hide at a nearby truck stop. When Hooper arrived, she found the two behind an 18-wheeler, and Cruz's mom asked if Hooper could keep him for the weekend - just until things at home calmed down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He never left,\" Hooper said. \"I had him from then on.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From student to son NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Neither Cruz nor Hooper thought his stay would be long term, but neither complained as the days, months and years went by. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If it was an hour, it was an hour I didn't have to spend there,\" Cruz said. \"You think, 'Hey, lunch? Lunch is great.' Lunch worked its way into dinner, and here we are 35 years later.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hooper said her husband, a retired firefighter, never questioned her decision to let Cruz stay, which she admires him for to this day. Gale and Cruz formed a bond of mutual respect Cruz had never experienced with the other father figures in his life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Cruz settled into his new life, the Hoopers bought him a new wardrobe and helped him get his first job, an Avalanche-Journal paper route, so he could make his own money and buy things he'd never had. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz also started performing better in school - credit that goes to retired special education teacher James Harris, Hooper said, who became another positive influence in Cruz's life. Under Harris' instruction, Cruz tested out of special education by his high school graduation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Everything was going well for the family until Cruz hurt his knee at school. Emergency room doctors would not give him stitches without a parent or legal guardian present. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That was the first catalyst of my going to his mother and asking for permission, No. 1, to be able to give him stitches,\" Hooper said. They also wanted to take Cruz on vacation to Fun Valley, Colorado, but would again need her signature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They got it, and Hooper carried that paper everywhere, eventually laminating it to keep it from fraying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I lived in fear every single day that they would just come jerk the whole thing away from me,\" Hooper said. \"Until he was about 16, I lived in absolute total fear that there would be a knock on the door saying, 'He is not yours. We want him back. There's nothing you can do about it.' And I would've had to give him up. I had no rights at that time.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hooper said by the time Cruz was 16, she thought if someone did try to take him away, she could take the matter to court and keep it there until he turned 18. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He was obviously mine by then,\" she said. \"After you show somebody what they can have, when they've got their own bedroom, when they've got their own clothes, when they've got a reason to get up in the morning and they change their whole attitude - he was no longer chip-on-his-shoulder anymore and happy all the time - then going back would be worse. It would be worse than if I had never shown him any of it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hooper's choice to claim him as her own didn't come without opposition. Her mother and friends - who now love Cruz, Hooper said - thought she had lost her mind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was a different era,\" Cruz said. \"Back in the early '80s, white people didn't adopt Mexican kids. It just didn't happen.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There was no formal adoption, however. At least not for a while. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He had asked many, many times to change his name to ours,\" Hooper said. \"We were afraid that he was young, that he might not understand what he was getting into, that you cannot change your ethnicity by changing your name, and all these things. We never said no, but we just never did it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hooper said she was on a school trip in Dallas when she got a phone call - her \"biggest joy\" - shortly before Cruz's 30th birthday. He wanted to be adopted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Becoming Cruz Hooper NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz said he had thought about legally changing his name since he was 18, but for one reason or another, it never happened. When he got married, he and his wife went by the surname Riojas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At age 29, however, Cruz decided to go through with it, and his attorney-aunt told him the easiest way would be to have the Hoopers adopt him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz said at first he thought he was a little old for that, but decided it was the best option. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I just thought it would honor my parents,\" he said, holding back tears. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a formal adoption ceremony Jan. 5, 1998, Cruz and his wife, Anel, legally became part of the family - last name and all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This was such a joy because we had four girls so there was not going to be a boy that would carry our name,\" Hooper said. \"When he asked us it was such a joy to us. Gale was so thrilled. Because see, now we have a son, and he will carry our name, and our grandchildren's names are Hooper. It was such a blessing to me even to be asked.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Hooper didn't need legal papers to prove what she had known in her heart for so long. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He was my son from the day I kept him,\" she said. \"In December of that year ... he was such a brat, I had already started loving him.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz does well in his job for payroll company Corporate Solutions in San Antonio, and the Hoopers joke he could buy and sell them any day. He generally keeps quiet about his past - Hooper recalled a time recently when someone told him, \"You wouldn't understand. You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth,\" and Cruz said nothing - choosing rather to focus on the present. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gale, a man of few words, didn't say much as he listened to his wife and son tell their story, but did interject one time to add, \"He's made me very proud.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz changed their lives, Hooper said, and in doing so, he changed the way she taught for 18 years after he left her classroom. She looked at students differently, thinking of them all as her Cruzes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the interview neared the end, Hooper wanted to make sure she said one more thing about her son, the boy who once caused her so much grief - the man who's now her pride and joy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With tears filling her eyes, Hooper paused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think he's really the one thing in my life I've done right.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR natalie.gross@lubbockonline.com NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • 766-2194 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Follow Natalie on Twitter NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR @AJ_NatalieGross\nPassage 2:\nStarting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

So by the time Cruz Riojas was set to enter the sixth grade, she issued a warning to the school’s principal: “I will quit if I have him in my class.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Courtesy of Linda Hooper NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then the story, as first reported in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, began to change. Sure enough, it was Hooper's classroom that the 12-year-old walked into in August 1980. He was far behind in academics — two years behind in reading and classified as special ed — and she quickly experienced his troubling behavior. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He had outbursts, threw chairs,\" Linda, now 68, told TODAY. \"If a child touched him, they’d be down on the floor in two seconds.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz, who is only now opening up about his story, lived with his mother, stepfather and five half-siblings, and suffered years of physical abuse at the hands of his stepfather. He was bused to Linda’s school wearing the same clothes every day, and he brought his troubling homelife with him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I made a joke about everything,” Cruz, now 45, told TODAY. “I wouldn’t let my stepfather see me cry, and I carried that with me to school.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz’s sixth-grade year included frequent clashes with his physical-education teacher, who sent him to Linda. “Every day (that teacher would) send him in and say, 'I’m not dealing with this kid, he’s yours,'\" she recalls. \"I didn’t know what to do, but he was in there, so I started letting him help me. I had him reshelving books, grading papers, to make that period go by. And he began to like to do stuff.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the student recognized that his teacher cared about him. “I saw that she just wouldn’t give up,\" Cruz said. \"She said, 'This persona that you project isn’t who you really are.' ” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Linda started having Cruz come to the home she shared with her husband Gale, a firefighter, and their four daughters. She’d give him money for small household chores, and arranged for his first job, a paper route. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Courtesy of Linda Hooper NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz developed a particularly remarkable relationship with his teacher's husband. “He never had a man in his life that was worth anything and he respected Gale,\" Linda said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He began spending more and more time at the Hooper home, and would frequently run the 7.5 miles between his home and theirs when he had a fight with his stepfather. But one day in February 1982, Linda received a call from Cruz’s mother that would change all of their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “His stepfather had beaten him, so she called me and asked, can I keep him until things blew over?” Linda recalls. “She put everything he owned in a cardboard box, and they huddled behind an 18-wheeler until I came to meet them.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz thought he'd only be staying with his teacher's family for an hour, but that hour turned into days, months, and then years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Linda recalls the first time Cruz stopped calling her \"Mrs. Hooper.\" “We were in a grocery store, and he wanted everyone to know I was his mother, because people would look at us funny. He said, 'MOTHER can I have this?' He was getting everyone’s attention, to say, 'Everybody look, this is my mom.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Courtesy Linda Hooper NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thanks to the Hoopers and another dedicated teacher, Cruz moved out of the special-education program and graduated with his peers. He went on to study at Texas Tech University and later met Anel Montemayor, his future wife. And just before his 30th birthday, Cruz called Linda to ask if she and Gale would officially adopt him. The answer was obvious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He said he wanted to honor us, and it was a big honor,\" Linda said. \"I’ve always known he loved me, but this really showed he loved us.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz and Anel Riojas became Cruz Riojas Hooper and Anel Montemayor-Hooper. They now live in San Antonio with their two children, Hannah, 13, and Greyson, 9. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cruz is careful to teach his children about their Mexican roots while also honoring the traditions and cultures from the Hooper side. He hasn’t yet shared with them the full story of his journey, but he’s getting there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “My parents taught me to never give up. Just persevere,\" he said. \"My father would always say, 'The light at the end of the tunnel isn’t always a train. It’s a light, and move toward it.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR\n", "answers": ["Cruz Riojas came from a troubled home: He was reportedly beaten by his stepfather, lived in a decrepit one-room lean-to with six other family members, and wore the same clothes to school every day, according to the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. He also caused trouble in school and was known as a “holy terror,” says Linda Hooper, a teacher who first encountered Cruz in the early ‘80s, when he was 12 years old. But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated. More than a decade later, he was still part of the Hooper family—but he wanted to make it official by asking the Hoopers to adopt him right before his 30th birthday. “He said he wanted to honor us, and it was a big honor,\" Hooper tells Today. \"I’ve always known he loved me, but this really showed he loved us.” The adoption went through in 1998, but Cruz \"was my son from the day I kept him,” Hooper says.

Without help he is still about 90% deaf, but, when using hearing aids, he could \"hear the wind blow and the birds tweet\", David Sorkin, his father, said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before the surgery, Kieran, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, said: \"I've always wanted big ears, and now I'm finally going to have them.\" Following the procedure his parents helped him to take a photograph of his newly crafted ear, or a \"side selfie\". Sorkin said he and his wife, Louise, were \"on cloud nine\" after the procedure. \"We could not have wished for a better result,\" Sorkin said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kieran struggled at his first school because he looked different to the other children. He has since moved to a school with a deafness unit in every year group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are a little bit more receptive to deafness and to a child looking different. But this will boost his confidence no end,\" Sorkin said. \"His reaction was just a 'wow', he is very happy.\" The 44-year-old IT manager added: \"It's been heart-wrenching for us and we've had the moral dilemma all along of whether it's right to change the features that Kieran was born with. But Kieran has talked about having ear surgery ever since the age of six when he saw a TV programme about it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was very important that this was Kieran's decision, and I think it's happened at exactly the right time for his development.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also described Kieran's difficulties at school, saying: \"He had problems at school in that he didn't gel very well in the groups because he looked different to other kids and he only had one or two friends at his previous school. He has now moved to a different school now and they have a deaf unit in every year so they are a little bit more receptive to deafness and to a child looking different.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kieran was born with bilateral microtia, a congenital deformity where the external ear is underdeveloped. It affects one in 100,000 babies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medics, led by Neil Bulstrode, GOSH consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon, have now turned his fortunes around. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the six-hour operation Bulstrode harvested the rib cartilage from both sides of Kieran's chest and then carved and shaped it into frameworks for Kieran's ears. When designing them he used an outline of Mrs Sorkin's ears as a \"family template\" to make them as close as possible to the ear shape that he might otherwise have had. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He then grafted the ears on to Kieran's head under pockets of skin and then used a vacuum to shape the skin to the contours of the new ear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Bilateral reconstructions are sometimes done one at a time, but for Kieran we have created both of his new ears at the same time,\" Bulstrode said. \"This allows us to ensure the ears are balanced and achieve the best result NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a major operation but it brings a significant improvement in quality of life for children with microtia. Their confidence improves exponentially and their performance at school improves,\" he said. \"If you can improve a young person's confidence, you can alter their whole trajectory in life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kieran will have a follow-up operation in six months' time, and hopefully he will not need to have any more, Mr Sorkin added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"These should last because they are cartilage and not prosthetics,\" he said NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A hospital spokeswoman said that researchers were working with the University College London Institute for Child Health to try to perform ear reconstructions for children like Kieran by growing new ear frameworks and other skeletal structures from a child's own stem cells. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They hope to be able to use stem cells from a child's own fat to create a new ear. Experts say that the approach would be far less invasive than the current treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR • This article was amended on 12 August 2014. The original headline stated: \"Boy born without ears can hear thanks to pioneering procedure\". As the story says, Kieran could already hear \"thanks to several previous operations and a hearing aid\".

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nine-year-old Kieran Sorkin had the surgery at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 100 children a year in the UK are born without one or both ears, a condition known as microtia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kieran was born deaf with small lobes where his ears should be. He can already hear, thanks to previous surgery to implant a hearing aid. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I want people to stop asking me questions\", said Kieran from Hertfordshire. \"I'd like just to look like my friends. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kieran's mum Louise Sorkin said: \"He's a very sociable boy and has longed for this operation for years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't want children bullying him because he's different. I just want him to be accepted like everyone else.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the morning of the operation, consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode stencils the shape of Louise Sorkin's ears. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said: \"When a patient has one ear we can match the new ear to that. Fortunately Kieran's mum has very pretty ears so that should work well.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Psychological benefits NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In theatre the surgical team remove cartilage from six of his ribs.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Great Ormond Street Hospital does about 40 of these operations each year, although most of those are to create one missing ear. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The surgery is cosmetic, not to improve hearing. But Mr Bulstrode said it brings huge psychological benefits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You see this when they come back. It's a huge boost for them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tissue engineering NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advances in tissue engineering mean that this kind of reconstructive surgery could be done quite differently within a decade. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists at the Institute of Child Health (ICH), part of University College London, are creating stem cells from patients' fat tissue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Institute, which is Great Ormond Street Hospital's research partner, induces the cells to make cartilage or bone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Patrizia Ferretti, leader of the ICH's Development and Regeneration Group, who is leading the study, said: \"This approach would be far less invasive for a child than the current method of harvesting a child's rib cartilage.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last year scientists in the US implanted a human-like ear, grown from cow and sheep cells, onto a rat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But such research is still at its early stages, and for the foreseeable future children needing new ears will benefit from the same procedure used at Great Ormond Street Hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three days after surgery, Kieran is given a mirror to look at his new ears. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image caption Kieran is delighted with his new ears NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His first reaction was \"Wow!\". Kieran started to giggle, but the operation on his ribs means it hurts when he laughs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kieran will need a second operation in six months to make his ears stand out from the scalp more, but he's already delighted with the result.\n", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less. Born deaf with no ears, Kieran was able to hear because of an implanted hearing aid, but he still wanted ears. \"I want people to stop asking me questions,\" he told the BBC. \"I'd like just to look like my friends. I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

During a ceremony Tuesday marking the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor 75 years ago, Obama cautioned against “the urge to turn inward” and stressed a need to “resist the urge to demonize those who are different” — remarks some thought were aimed partly at Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump also made it clear Wednesday that he is perturbed by a number of steps the Obama administration is taking in its final weeks related to Israel, including a speech that was planned Wednesday by Secretary of State John F.

Simpson and Carlie did not return home later that afternoon and the following day an Amber Alert was issued in Tennessee.Shannon Trent tells PEOPLE she has not had custody of Carlie or her 7-year-old sister for about two years, saying, \"I just recently got my life straight and I just wish I could at least see my girls again.\"When she heard that her daughter had been allegedly kidnapped by Simpson, she was shocked by the news – but not as much by the suspect.\"I've always had a gut feeling,\" Trent tells PEOPLE. \"I've always had a bad feeling about Gary [and] I should have stuck with my gut.\"Trent tells PEOPLE that Simpson has been part of the family for 34 years and was given custody of his nieces when Carlie's father, James, was having what she describes as \"problems.\" At the time of Carlie's disappearance, James had custody of her.\"He was a very trusted family member. If we had known anything like this, we would have never let our kids around him,\" Trent says.Josh DeVine of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation tells PEOPLE that in order to pick up Carlie, Simpson allegedly told teachers that James had been in a car accident and he was sent to get her. But Devine says this was a lie and that Simpson had no authority to pick Carlie up.On Tuesday, authorities said that before Simpson allegedly kidnapped his niece, he bought girls underwear, a bikini, clothing, lipstick, nail polish, blankets and a child's camping chair at a local WalMart \"It made me sick to my stomach. I mean, I almost got sick,\" Trent says of the items Simpson allegedly purchased. \"I don't know what he's done to her. I don't think he would hurt her, but if he's capable of kidnapping a child he's capable of anything.\"Authorities say the items purchased by Simpson confirm their suspicion that he allegedly brought Carlie to a remote area or campground. Trent says she believes the alleged kidnapping was premeditated.\"And just to think he's had this planned for a long time,\" Trent says. \"I think he's got a lair or something or some sort of shelter.\"After the alleged kidnapping, Simpson brought Carlie to a local grocery store and bought non-perishable food items and toiletries, officials said. In a surveillance video from a Save-A-Lot, Carlie doesn't appear to be distressed, officials said. However there is still concern for her safety.\"We believe this girl to be in imminent danger. As the days go, our concern for [Carlie's] well-being only grows,\" DeVine said at a press conference on Tuesday.Trent says she and her family will not stop looking for their daughter.

We will find her – we have to find her.\"She adds, \"And Carlie, Mommy and Daddy are searching high and low and doing everything we can do to save you.\"James Trent told Inside Edition he believes Simpson has an obsession with his daughter.\"I personally think that for some reason, he's developed this obsession with Carlie,\" he said. \"I wonder what he's trying to put in her head, what kind of story he's told her [about] why he's doing what he's doing.\"Simpson was last seen driving a white 2002 Dodge Conversion Van with Tennessee registration number 173GPS.On Tuesday, Missouri authorities issued an Amber Alert after it was believed Simpson was spotted near Otterville. However, hours later, authorities announced the alert was a false alarm.Carlie is described as 4'8\" tall, weighing about 75 lbs., with blonde hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a black and gray tank top with blue jeans.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new team will start Jan. 3. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There had been little inkling that alterations were afoot, although the show had changed its executive producer, David Friedman, within the past year. Friedman said he believed the new team had the right energy and chemistry to embark on another effort at lifting the show out of third place in the network morning news ratings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's less about what we weren't getting and less about a generational change or a different direction,\" Friedman said. \"We just literally think this is the right team going forward.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Early Show\" has consistently ranked behind the morning champ, NBC's \"Today\" show, and ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" The week before Thanksgiving was typical. \"Today\" averaged 5.6 million viewers each day, \"GMA\" had 4.6 million and \"The Early Show\" had 2.9 million, the Nielsen Co. said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CBS News President Sean McManus said he won't be expecting any immediate ratings changes in a time where \"Today\" hasn't lost a single week in nearly 15 years. But he said he believed the new team will help the show grow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This group, I think, will work very well together,\" McManus said. \"I think the chemistry will be very good.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We just felt the timing was right to start planning for the future,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith had the longest tenure on \"The Early Show.\" He was the sole survivor from 2002 when CBS installed a four-anchor team that included Smith, Hannah Storm, Julie Chen and Rene Syler. Chen still contributes occasional reports to the show; the others have left CBS News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Smith also hosted a previous CBS morning show from 1987 to 1996. CBS said he'll stay at the network as a news reporter and primary substitute at the \"CBS Evening News,\" \"Face the Nation\" and \"Sunday Morning.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alerted that changes were coming, Smith said he took a \"long walk on a cold golf course\" Sunday and reflected on doing the CBS morning show for 17 of the last 25 years. \"To be honest, I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunities I've had,\" he said, confirming that he plans to stay at CBS. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have given them everything I can possibly give,\" said Smith, 59. \"I wish the people who follow nothing but the best. God love 'em, I hope they can move the (ratings) needle more.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wragge worked in sports, including a stint as a sideline reporter at events for NBC, until he made the jump to news in 2006. Beside his weekend job at CBS, he had been anchoring local news broadcasts at the network's New York affiliate, a job he'll give up to go national. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hill, who came to CBS from CNN, briefly filled in for Rodriguez last year when Rodriguez was on maternity leave. She's the only holdover from the current daily program, although in a different role. Currently, she reads the newscasts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wragge and Hill's growth as a team has been evident on Saturday mornings, and they've proven adept at shifting between hard news and lighter fare, McManus said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They're uniquely suited to each other and to the morning show genre,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Friedman said it's an advantage for CBS that its regular viewers know each of the new personalities, except for weather forecaster Castro. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You're not introducing somebody to the morning genre that has never been in the morning genre,\" he said. \"That is a little bit tougher.\" That's likely a reference to the other recent morning transition, where George Stephanopoulos replaced Diane Sawyer as a co-host at \"Good Morning America\" late last year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's hard to fault CBS for looking to shake things up,\" said David Bianculli, a veteran television critic and now a media professor at Rowan University in New Jersey. \"I have a lot of respect for Harry Smith, but for a long time, this has not been working on a daily basis.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The suddenness of the \"bloodbath\" was surprising, Bianculli said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Anything that's done this quickly smells of desperation,\" he said.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush led the U.S. to a swift and decisive victory in the first Persian Gulf War and presided over the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union and unification of Germany, before a painful recession cost him a second term as president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He died on Friday at age 94. His wife of more than 70 years, Barbara, died at the age of 92 earlier this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Bush was the last American president to serve in World War II, a fight that helped shape his life and the lives of many in his generation. He went on to build a sterling resume—businessman, member of Congress, envoy to the United Nations and China, head of the Central Intelligence Agency—before becoming Republican Ronald Reagan’s vice president in 1980 and then succeeding him in the White House in the election in 1988. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He lost his bid for re-election to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, after a campaign in which he was hampered by two years of disappointing economic performance and an insurrection among his own party’s conservatives over a decision to raise taxes. The loss was a bitter personal disappointment, but one he handled with the kind of grace that allowed him to become friends with Mr. Clinton in later life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In subsequent years, historians have been far kinder regarding the Bush presidency than were voters at the time. Mr. Bush also won some degree of vindication when his eldest son, George W. Bush, won the White House in 2000, making Mr. Bush the only American since John Adams to be both a president and father of a president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR George H.W. Bush was born June 12, 1924, in Milton, Mass. His father, Prescott Bush, was a successful Wall Street executive and, later, a U.S. senator from Connecticut. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The son appeared set to follow his father’s steps from elite prep school to Yale and on to a career in the financial industry when World War II broke out. The younger Mr. Bush joined the Navy and, when sworn in on his 18th birthday, became its youngest pilot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He flew 58 missions in the Pacific, piloting an Avenger torpedo bomber—with his girlfriend Barbara’s name painted on its side—from an aircraft carrier. He was shot down and was rescued by a submarine, a rescue captured in what became a famous bit of grainy film footage. Two other crewmen died; Mr. Bush was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photos: The Life of President George H.W. Bush The 41st president served from 1989 to 1993 and was the father of a president and a former Florida governor. Mr. Bush, arriving from a day trip to Columbia, S.C., on Feb. 15, 1989, waved to the White House balcony where first lady Barbara Bush was waiting for him.

Charles Tasnadi/Associated Press NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Upon returning from the war, he married that girlfriend, the former Barbara Pierce, and finished his education at Yale, but eschewed the path to Wall Street that his family ties offered. Instead, with the help of a dose of family money, he moved to Midland, Texas, where he became a businessman in the oil-field supply, exploration and production businesses. Later, he co-founded Zapata Petroleum, which pioneered offshore oil-drilling platforms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Bush family eventually moved to Houston, where he began his political career as chairman of the Harris County Republican Party. After an unsuccessful run for a Senate seat, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1966 and served two terms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He then lost another race for a U.S. Senate seat, a defeat that might well have ended his political career. But he was rescued by President Richard Nixon, who named him ambassador to the United Nations. A series of other top appointments followed, including chairman of the Republican National Committee, envoy to China and director of the CIA. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That string of jobs made Mr. Bush a sufficiently prominent figure in the Republican Party, and he decided to seek the presidency in 1980. For a time he was the leading contender, particularly after scoring a surprise win in the Iowa caucuses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He had long embraced his father’s brand of moderate Republican politics, and labeled the tax-cut plans of his main conservative foe, Mr. Reagan, as “voodoo economics.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a conservative wave was sweeping the GOP, and it carried Mr. Reagan to the nomination. At a dramatic convention in Detroit, Mr. Reagan flirted with asking a former president, Gerald Ford, to serve as his running mate, before deciding that wouldn’t be a workable plan. At the last minute, he asked Mr. Bush to run with him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a potentially uncomfortable fit, but Mr. Bush was unswerving in his loyalty to Mr. Reagan. He embodied what former Secretary of State George Shultz called in a memoir “the loyal lieutenant role,” intimately involved in the councils of power and serving as a confidential adviser to the president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also left few traces of his own influence. When the Iran-Contra scandal rocked the Reagan administration in 1986, Mr. Bush escaped censure by claiming he had been “out of the loop” when decisions were made to trade arms for hostages. He attended so many state funerals that some joked his motto was “You die, I fly.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Bush’s shining moment as vice president came in the aftermath of the 1981 assassination attempt on Mr. Reagan, when the president lay near death in the hospital and the nation seemed leaderless. While Secretary of State Al Haig memorably declared himself “in charge,” Mr. Bush slid into place, easing the crisis atmosphere without seeming to arrogate power to himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He ran to succeed Mr. Reagan, won the nomination and announced to the 1988 Republican convention that he envisioned a “kinder and gentler nation.” That was a rhetorical signal of at least a slight shift to the center after the Reagan years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But, in an effort to deflect skepticism among some conservatives, Mr. Bush also declared, “Read my lips: No new taxes,” a fateful promise that came back to haunt and eventually help undo his presidency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the economy and the nation’s fiscal condition deteriorated, Mr. Bush abandoned the no-tax-hike pledge and signed a tax-raising measure. The decision evoked anger and a sense of betrayal among conservatives and led to a primary challenge from the right’s firebrand Pat Buchanan. Mr. Bush also was hurt by a weak base in Washington; he was only the second American president to serve a full term without party control in either chamber of Congress. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier Former first lady Barbara Bush has died at the age of 92. She was the wife of 41st president George H.W. Bush, mother of 43rd president, George W. Bush, and 2016 candidate Jeb Bush. During and after her time in the White House she championed the cause of improving literacy rates among Americans. Photo: Reuters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Bush was far more in his element on international affairs. After Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, Mr. Bush—aided by his close associates, Brent Scowcroft as national security adviser and James Baker as secretary of state—patiently wove a diplomatic and military web that trapped the Iraqi leader and led to a lightning war that successfully drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, the Bush administration delicately handled the immediate potentially explosive political fallout among old adversaries and, through patient diplomacy, helped pave the way for a largely peaceful series of revolutions in Eastern Europe that culminated in the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Bush proved himself willing to use American military might elsewhere. He first took military action in 1989, when he ordered the removal of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After success in the 100-hour Persian Gulf War, the greatest U.S. military victory since World War II, Mr. Bush seemed the captain of an American juggernaut. His approval rating approached 90%. He and advisers began talking about a “new world order” of international equilibrium. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the American electorate turned fickle in the face of high unemployment and a sluggish economy, and Mr. Buchanan mounted a primary challenge to his re-election in 1992. He never fully recovered and lost the election to Mr. Clinton. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Bush inspired generations of Americans to public service, President Trump said in a statement early Saturday. “Along with his full life of service to country, we will remember President Bush for his devotion to family—especially the love of his life, Barbara.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In retirement, Mr. Bush undertook a few diplomatic missions and celebrated his birthday into his mid-80s with a parachute jump. He developed postpresidential friendships with former foes, including Bob Dole, a fellow World War II veteran. And he built a strong bond with Bill Clinton, which began when the two former presidents worked together to raise money for victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 and continued as they occasionally joined forces on other projects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While his son George W. Bush was elected president and managed to win the second term that had eluded him, Mr. Bush stayed largely in the background. Later, Mr. Bush again stayed largely in the background while his wife, Barbara, gave interviews supporting son Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Bush found a way, though, to signal his unhappiness with the man who vanquished his son in the 2016 election, Donald Trump. He stayed away from his party’s 2016 convention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Barbara Bush died, Mr. Bush’s office described the former president as heartbroken but strong and stoic. Of her passing, Mr. Bush said: “We have faith she is in heaven, and we know life will go on—as she would have it. So cross the Bushes off your worry list.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Write to Gerald F. Seib at jerry.seib@wsj.com\nPassage 2:\n“It is my considered judgment that you should now resign.

Here are some early highlights: The broad strokes: For a thorough obituary and assessment, start with the Washington Post. Its story notes that while Bush served just one term as president, it was a consequential one. \"The Berlin Wall fell; the Soviet Union ceased to exist; the communist bloc in Eastern Europe broke up; the Cold War ended.\" And Bush's \"firm, restrained diplomatic sense helped assure the harmony and peace with which these world-shaking events played out, one after the other.\" Great detail: In its obituary, the Wall Street Journal notes that Bush flew 58 missions in the Pacific as a Navy pilot in WWII, all with the name of his girlfriend—Barbara—on the side of the plane.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nBy Laura Woods/GoBankingRates NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Oct. 3, 1995, a jury acquitted Orenthal James \"O.J.\" Simpson of the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. The murders -- and resulting O.J. Simpson trial and verdict -- drastically changed many peoples' opinions of the former football sensation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than two decades later, Simpson sits behind bars after being convicted for entirely different crimes. But that could change soon. On Thursday, Simpson will appear before a Nevada judge to make his case for parole. If parole is granted, \"The Juice\" could be on the loose as soon as Oct. 1. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In anticipation of the hearing, let's take a look at O.J. Simpson's net worth, as well as revisit his infamous murder trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Estimated net worth: $250,000 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His bank account was once flush, but O.J. Simpson now has little money left from his days has a high-earning football star. Celebrity Net Worth reports O.J. Simpson's net worth was $10.8 million when he and Nicole Brown Simpson divorced in 1992. That sum is equal to more than $19 million as of May 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The divorce settlement revealed Simpson was earning $55,000 per month in 1992 — more than $97,000 in May 2017 dollars. Much of this was from car rental company Hertz, where he served as spokesperson for nearly 20 years. Simpson was earning $550,000 per year from the company at the time of his divorce, according to The Washington Post. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Money has seemingly been tight for Simpson since the Nicole Brown murder trial. Despite being acquitted in the famous criminal case, he was found guilty in a subsequent civil suit and ordered to pay $33.5 million to the Brown and Goldman families in February 1997. In a 2014 interview with CNBC, Goldman's sister Kim said the family has collected less than 1 percent of the judgment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also in 1997, Simpson defaulted on the mortgage of his estate in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, and the property went into foreclosure. Simpson purchased the 6,200-square-foot mansion for $650,000 in 1977. The new owner paid $4 million for the house before demolishing it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Football career and acting highlights NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR O.J. Simpson's football career is nothing short of legendary. The Heisman Trophy winner made a name for himself as a member of the University of Southern California football team, when he pulled off a jaw-dropping 64-yard run against UCLA. He was chosen by the Buffalo Bills as the first pick in the 1969 NFL draft. Simpson played for the team for nine seasons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1973, the running back made history as the first NFL player to rush more than 2,000 yards in a season. Simpson retired from the NFL in 1979, after spending his final two seasons with the San Francisco 49ers. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also an actor, Simpson appeared in nearly three dozen films and television shows from 1968 to 2008. Some of his most high-profile works included playing Nordberg in \"The Naked Gun\" movie franchise and T.D. Parker in the television series \"1st and Ten: The Championship.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nicole Brown murder trial NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman, were found stabbed to death outside her Brentwood condominium. Days later, O.J. Simpson was charged with the murders. After promising to turn himself in, Simpson famously led police on a 60-mile low-speed chase in a white Ford Bronco. He eventually surrendered at his Brentwood home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Regarded as the trial of the century, the O.J. Simpson trial ran from Jan. 24, 1995 to Oct. 2, 1995. Judge Lance A. Ito allowed cameras in the courtroom, granting the public a front row seat. Some 150 million viewers tuned in to watch the reading of the not-guilty verdict, making it one of the most watched events in history. The country is still divided regarding the O.J. Simpson trial and verdict today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prison sentence NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR O.J. Simpson now sits in a Nevada jail for crimes entirely unrelated to the Nicole Brown murder. This punishment stems from a September 2007 robbery, where Simpson and five other men forced their way into sports memorabilia collector Bruce Fromong's Las Vegas hotel room and robbed him at gunpoint. Simpson said he was trying to reclaim personal items stolen from his home years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The guilty verdict in this O.J. Simpson court case came on the 13th anniversary of his double murder acquittal. The former athlete and his co-defendant were found guilty on 12 charges, including conspiracy to commit a crime, robbery, assault and kidnapping with a deadly weapon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After this O.J. Simpson trial, \"The Juice\" was sentenced to anywhere from nine to 33 years in prison. The Nevada parole board won't decide his fate until July 20, but the outlook appears to be in Simpson's favor. He already went before the board on five of his charges in July 2013 and was granted parole on those offenses. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If he's released, Simpson will be able to live on his NFL pension, which is an estimated $25,000 per month. By law, the Brown and Goldman families are unable to touch these funds to settle the judgment against Simpson.

(Photo: Ethan Miller, AP) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When O.J. Simpson leaves prison for the first time in almost a decade, possibly as early as Oct. 1, he will no doubt have a list of things he wants to do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR See his children. Reconnect with old friends. Play golf. Figure out why people are making themselves look like dogs, mice and pieces of bread in photos on smart phones that will disappear in 24 hours.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR RELATED: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson’s release from prison – his parole hearing in Nevada on Thursday is considered something of a formality – will produce a spectacle unlike anything we’ve seen since he went behind bars. He’s been a national obsession for the better part of a quarter-century now, these past nine years the closest there’s been to a respite, and his release from prison will only renew the rabid curiosity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Has his time behind bars changed him? Does Simpson, who turned 70 on July 9, look different? Is he repentant? Humbled? What does he have to say now about the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It might be tempting, both financially and psychologically, to indulge the hype. A few months back, there was even speculation he could land a reality TV show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also would be the worst possible thing he could do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Instead of courting the spotlight, Simpson needs to disappear. Walk out of prison, head straight for an SUV with tinted windows – definitely not a white Ford Bronco – and vanish from the public eye, leaving the gawkers in his wake without so much as a wave or a glance backward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Otherwise, he risks falling into the same toxic mentality that landed him in prison in the first place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He just says, 'We’ll be together again, my life will go back to normal,’ ” longtime friend Tom Scotto told USA TODAY Sports over the weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Normal? There’s never been such a thing for O.J. Simpson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Hall of Fame running back who became a beloved broadcaster, actor and pitchman, Simpson wasn’t just a household name. He was a welcome guest in every American household. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until the murders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Bronco chase, the so-called “trial of the century,” the bloody glove, those “ugly-ass shoes,” even a Kardashian thrown in for good measure – we didn’t realize it then, but the O.J. circus was the advent of reality TV. Everything about Simpson, before and after the trial, became a source of fascination. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson was acquitted of murder charges Oct. 3, 1995, but was found responsible for Brown and Goldman’s deaths two years later in civil court. He was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages to their families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That’s not why he’s in prison, though. A confrontation with memorabilia collectors in Las Vegas led to armed robbery and kidnapping charges, and he was sentenced to a minimum of nine years in 2008. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson’s time behind bars hasn’t diminished interest in him. A documentary on him won an Oscar this year while a television series dominated the Emmys last year. It’s no surprise, really. We have become a culture that revels in celebrity, drama and other people’s misfortunes, and Simpson checks every one of those boxes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Which makes a vanishing act all the more imperative. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson knows what happens when ego and hubris get the best of him. “I just wish I’d have never gone to that room,” he said, referring to the Las Vegas robbery, during a 2013 hearing that led to him being paroled on five of the lesser charges against him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There’s even less benefit now to being a public curiosity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sure, there will be some who wish Simpson well. But many more will be rooting just as hard for him to fail. Opinions were set hard and fast long ago, and nothing Simpson does after his release is likely to change them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Besides, any money he makes wouldn’t be his for long, anyway, with the Brown and Goldman families expected to renew their pursuit of the millions they’re owed. Though Simpson can shield many of his assets – his NFL pension, for example, is protected by law – Goldman’s father was awarded the rights to Simpson’s supposed confessional, If I Did It. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though Simpson’s friend Scotto says the former football player is “in the best shape I’ve ever seen him,” we all have expiration dates and Simpson is closer to his now than when he went to prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He’s wasted the past nine years of his life. Unless he stays out of the spotlight, he’s likely to burn the rest, too.

Simpson will find out on Thursday if he soon will be released from the Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada. He has been held there for nearly nine years for convictions on armed robbery and other charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former NFL hero, TV pitchman and movie star, now 70, stands a good chance of being granted parole when he appears before the Nevada Parole Board via video link. No one has registered to testify against him. He will likely try to persuade the board of his good behavior behind bars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If paroled, Simpson would be released from prison no sooner than Oct. 1. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enlarge this image toggle caption AP/Nevada Department of Corrections AP/Nevada Department of Corrections NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As with all things O.J., there has been a tremendous media interest in the parole hearing. Thirty media organizations will be on-site in Carson City and at Lovelock Correctional Center, and many outlets will be streaming it live. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ordinarily, the parole board's decision would be announced a few weeks after the hearing. But the board announced that it will rule in Simpson's case the same day as the hearing, saying that it has been a \"disruption\" and the board wants to \"return to normal as soon as possible after the hearing.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's not the way many Americans imagined he'd do time. The fame and adulation he once enjoyed are hard to overestimate. But it's also hard to overestimate how shocked his fans were when he was arrested in 1994 in the brutal slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was acquitted of the murder charges in what became known as \"the trial of the century.\" But years later, he couldn't beat the more mundane criminal charges stemming from a burglary gone wrong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1995, when Simpson was acquitted in the brutal stabbing deaths of his ex-wife and her friend, opinions on the verdict broke down largely along racial lines. Many African-Americans believed that the verdict was fair, but most whites thought he'd gotten away with murder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two award-winning 2016 television productions provided reminders of how shocking the murder charges, trial and verdict were at the time: ESPN's documentary O.J.: Made in America and FX's The People v. O.J. Simpson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson had been a Heisman Trophy winner while playing football in college. He made the NFL Hall of Fame. After retiring from sports, he became a commentator and actor. He starred in commercials for Hertz Rental Cars that showed him hurdling obstacles in an airport the way he once hurdled defensive linemen. He proved himself a decent comic foil in the popular Naked Gun movies. He was glamorous and rich. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But after all his glory and his infamy, he was convicted of a botched 2007 burglary in a cheap Las Vegas hotel. Along with a handful of accomplices, the former star broke into the room of a couple of sports memorabilia dealers. They had some items that Simpson believed belonged to him and that he wanted back. A couple of guys with Simpson brought guns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson was later convicted on 12 criminal counts including armed robbery, kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to nine to 33 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his 2013 parole hearing, Simpson told the Nevada Parole Board that he wished he'd never gone into the hotel room. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I wish I'd said, 'Keep it and not worry about it,' \" Simpson said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also argued to the parole board that he'd been a model prisoner. When he'd arrived at Lovelock, \"I gave [prison officials] my word that I would try to be, or would be, the best prisoner they ever had here. And I think for the most part, I've kept my word on that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He spoke via video conference from prison, while the parole board met in Carson City more than 100 miles away. That same procedure will be followed Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In making parole decisions, the state of Nevada uses a scoring system to evaluate the risk a prisoner might pose to the community. The categories include an inmate's behavior in prison, as well as age. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He deserves parole. It's as simple as that,\" says Yale Galanter, one of Simpson's defense attorneys in the armed robbery case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Galanter believes that the Las Vegas jury was dishing out some payback, not so much for Simpson's murder acquittal 13 years earlier, but for a 2007 book that Simpson co-authored called, If I Did It. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Galanter says he could hear the jury's anger over the book when he questioned them. And he didn't blame them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"How do you write a book that your children are going to see called 'If I killed your mother?' and 'If I killed your mother's friend?' I thought that was a totally, socially disgusting act.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1997, two years after his acquittal, Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Brown and Goldman in a civil suit brought by their families. He was ordered to give control of the book to the Goldman family as partial payment of the civil judgment, and they changed the name to If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer.\nPassage 4:\nFormer football star and actor O.J.

Simpson could be one step closer to freedom after more than eight years in a Nevada prison. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson, 70, could be released from Lovelock Correctional Center by Oct. 1 if the state Parole Board rules favorably on his release request following a Thursday hearing. Simpson will take part from Lovelock, a medium security facility where he is serving his sentence. The hearing will be teleconferenced to the board in Carson City. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four members of the Parole Board will deliberate in private following the 10 a.m. testimony and then take a public vote.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Media interest in the hearing is overwhelming, unlike his first hearing in 2013 when Simpson was paroled from his first set of sentences for convictions related to the 2007 robbery of two memorabilia collectors at the Palace Station hotel-casino in Las Vegas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson is serving a nine- to 33-year sentence for the 12 convictions — including kidnapping and armed robbery — related to the incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson said he was trying to recover memorabilia stolen from him. In his 2013 parole hearing, Simpson expressed remorse for the armed heist of memorabilia collectors Bruce Fromong and Alfred Beardsley. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson was found not guilty by a Los Angeles jury in 1995 of the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman, in one of the most celebrated trials in American history.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sentences that are aggregated for purposes of the hearing include four concurrent sentences for use of a deadly weapon and two consecutive sentences for assault with a deadly weapon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the hearings are public, testimony is limited to the inmate, a representative of the inmate, if any, victims of the crime and one family member or supporter of the inmate. The board will consider confidential information, including a pre-sentence investigation, a parole hearing report, a risk assessment and letters of support or opposition, if any. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well behaved NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Simpson said at his 2013 parole hearing that he had been a model inmate during his five years in Lovelock.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Details of Jamaica's licensing authority and its hoped-for medical marijuana sector will need to be refined in coming months. But for now, Jamaican cannabis crusaders applauded the amendments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a big step in the right direction, but there's still a lot of work to do,\" said Delano Seiveright, director of the Cannabis Commercial and Medicinal Taskforce.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drug — also called weed or pot — has long been associated with the Caribbean island country, but it has always remained illegal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR National security minister Peter Bunting said the change came after an \"elephantine\" slog through parliament that took decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"To describe this Bill's development as elephantine, is to label it in euphemistic terms since the parliamentary deliberations on it commenced as far back as 38 years ago,\" he said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new law makes possession of small quantities of pot a non-arrestable offence that can instead result in a fine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It will also permit the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The legislation paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp, the minister's statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is significant because it begins to correct decades of criminalising tens of thousands of Jamaicans, mostly poor young black males, for possession of a little 'spliff',\" Mr Bunting said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This progressive legislation also begins to correct the victimisation of our Rastafarian brethren which started in colonial times and continued after Independence.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rastafarianism, the religion followed by late Jamaican reggae star Bob Marley, includes the ritualistic use of marijuana.

Jamaica's parliament last night approved a law decriminalizing small amounts of pot, the AP reports. People found with 2 ounces or less of marijuana will now simply receive a ticket—not a crime on their record—and cultivation of five plants or fewer is now allowed. A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement. Jamaica also hopes to boost its health tourism and medical marijuana industries and make it a major player in the pot product market, the Guardian notes.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A multi-national task force of ships, planes and helicopters have been scouring the northern Java Sea and coastline of southern Borneo to recover the bodies of victims and locate the wreck of Flight QZ8501 and its black box flight recorders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've found four big parts from the plane we're looking for,\" search and rescue agency chief Fransiskus Bambang Soelistyo told reporters in Jakarta. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The breakthrough came as authorities said that Indonesia AirAsia had violated the terms of its licence for the Surabaya to Singapore route by flying on a Sunday, the day the Airbus A320-200 plunged into the Java Sea, and announced they would investigate the carrier's other schedules. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One large object was pinpointed by a ship searching during the night, Soelistyo said, and three more, the largest of which was around 18 metres long, were located on Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another official, Supriyadi, who is coordinating the operation from the port of Pangkalan Bun in Borneo, said earlier that poor visibility had hampered efforts to capture images of the objects with underwater remote operating vehicles (ROVs). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The visibility is only two metres,\" he said. \"It's cloudy, making it difficult for the cameras to detect.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Divers, including a team of Russian specialists who just arrived in Pangkalan Bun, may be able to investigate the suspected wreckage on Sunday if the weather improves, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NO SURVIVORS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No survivors have been found from the crash, which happened about 40 minutes after the plane took off from Indonesia's second largest city in an area known for intense tropical thunderstorms during the current monsoon season. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A report from Indonesia's weather bureau said it was likely the plane had flown into bad weather which would have been difficult to avoid, and that it was possible this had caused ice to form on its engines. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Based on the available data on the last received location of the aircraft, the weather was a factor in causing the accident,\" the weather bureau said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indonesian authorities on Friday questioned whether the pilot had followed correct weather procedures, and later suspended Indonesia AirAsia's Surabaya to Singapore flights, saying the airline's operating licence only permitted flights on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Djoko Murdjatmodjo, Indonesia's acting Director General of Air Transportation, said on Saturday that the Transport Ministry would investigate other routes used by the carrier, which flies from at least 15 Indonesian destinations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are going to investigate all AirAsia flight schedules. Hopefully we can start on next Monday,\" he said. \"It is possible AirAsia's licence in Indonesia might be revoked,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sunu Widyatmoko, Indonesia AirAsia chief, told reporters the airline, which is 49-percent owned by Malaysia-based AirAsia, would cooperate with the inquiry. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The government has suspended our flights from Surabaya to Singapore and back,\" he said. \"They are doing the evaluation process. AirAsia will cooperate fully with the evaluation.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Much effort has focused on finding the mostly Indonesian victims of the crash. Thirty bodies have been recovered from the sea, although rescue official Supriyadi, who like many Indonesians uses just one name, said it was unlikely more would be found floating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Because we're already in the seventh day ... the chances are they have all sunk,\" he said. \"There's a possibility they'll be found on beaches.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Small pieces of the aircraft and other debris have also been found, but there has been no sign of the crucial voice and flight data recorders - the so-called black boxes that investigators hope will unravel the sequence of events in the cockpit during the doomed jet's final minutes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WEATHER FACTOR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The cause of the crash, the first fatal accident suffered by the AirAsia group, remains unexplained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plane was flying at 32,000 ft (9,753 metres) and the pilot had asked to climb to 38,000 ft just before contact was lost. When air traffic controllers granted permission to fly at 34,000 ft a few minutes later there was no response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A source close to the investigation said radar data appeared to show the aircraft made an \"unbelievably\" steep climb before it crashed, possibly pushing it beyond the A320's limits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hadi Mustofa Djuraid, a transport ministry official, told reporters on Friday that authorities were also investigating the possibility that the pilot did not ask for a weather report from the meteorological agency at the time of take-off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indonesia AirAsia said in a statement that weather reports were printed in hard copy at the operations control centre at all its flight hubs, including Surabaya, and taken by the pilot to the aircraft before each flight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An AirAsia spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the pilot had followed the procedure described in the statement.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AirAsia’s Airbus 320 disappeared around 40 minutes after taking off from the Indonesian city of Surabaya last Sunday morning with 162 people on board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the company was only authorised to fly that route on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, Indonesia’s transport ministry said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It violated the route permit given, the schedule given, that's the problem,\" Djoko Murjatmodjo, the head of air transport, told AFP on Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was not immediately clear why AirAsia had been flying that day if it did not have permission. All the company’s flights from Surabaya to Singapore have now been ordered to stop. The transport ministry has announced a full review of all AirAsia flights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sunu Widyatmoko, the chief executive of AirAsia’s Indonesian subsidiary, confirmed government officials had suspended the airline’s permission to fly from Surabaya to Singapore but declined to comment further.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though strong currents and big surf have prevented divers from entering waters to get a visual of the suspected fuselage, officials are hopeful they will find many of the 162 passengers and crew who were aboard the plane still strapped in their seats inside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So far, after nearly a week of searching, only 30 bodies have been found floating in the choppy waters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Airbus A320 crashed Dec. 28, halfway into a two-hour flight from Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, to Singapore. Minutes before losing contact, the pilot told air traffic control that he was approaching threatening clouds, but was denied permission to climb to a higher altitude because of heavy air traffic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It remains unclear what caused the plane to plunge into the Java Sea, though bad weather appears to have been a factor, according to a 14-page report released by Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Flight 8501 appears to have been trapped in bad weather that would have been difficult to avoid,\" the report said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the plane's black boxes — the flight data and cockpit voice recorders — have yet to be located, the discovery of the wreckage, especially if it is largely intact, would greatly benefit the investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The objects on the seafloor were discovered Friday and Saturday, and an Indonesian Geological Survey vessel was used to assess their dimensions, Soelistyo said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to what appeared to be a significant part of the plane's body, chunks of debris found in the target search area measured up to 12 meters (39 feet) long. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other suspected plane parts were seen scattered on beaches during an aerial survey, Soelistyo said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indonesian authorities announced the grounding of AirAsia flights from Surabaya to Singapore, with the Transport Ministry saying the airline did not have a permit to fly on Sundays. However, Singapore's Civil Aviation Authority said Saturday that from its end, the airline had been approved to fly the route daily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AirAsia, which began operations in 2001, quickly becoming one of the region's most popular low-cost carriers, said it was reviewing the suspension. The crash was the airline's first. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Strong currents and towering waves as high as 4 meters (13 feet) have slowed recovery efforts, scattering bodies and debris in all directions. The discoveries so far include an emergency exit door and slide, as well as a backpack with food and a camera inside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As part of the investigation into the crash, autopsies will be carried out on some of the bodies, including the pilot and co-pilot, whose remains have not yet been recovered, said Budiyono, who heads East Java's Disaster Victim Identification unit and, like many Indonesians, uses only one name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Generally, aviation experts say the more passengers, luggage and parts of the aircraft that remain intact, the more likely the plane hit the water in one piece. That would signal problems like a mechanical error or a stall instead of a mid-air breakup due to an explosion or sudden depressurization. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For family members, the wait has been agonizing, with local media covering every development and theory, many of which have proved to be untrue — including a false report that a body was found wearing a life jacket, which would have indicated passengers had time to prepare for the impact or miraculously were able to put them on after hitting the water. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With more corpses arriving in Surabaya, some relatives said they were simply worn out. But they were encouraged by reports that parts of the plane had been detected and hoped that everyone on board would be retrieved. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Let's hope the news is true,\" said Ongko Gunawan, whose sister was on the flight with her husband and their child. \"We need to move on.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vessels involved in the search for debris included at least eight sophisticated navy ships from Singapore, Russia, Malaysia and the U.S. equipped with sonars for scouring the seabed to pinpoint the all-important black boxes and the wreckage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A second U.S. Navy ship arrived Saturday to help in the search. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hope, officials say, is that the body of the plane will still be largely intact, speeding the investigation.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nHabeas corpus, or the Great Writ, is the legal procedure that keeps the government from holding you indefinitely without showing cause. When you challenge your detention by filing a habeas corpus petition, the executive branch must explain to a neutral judge its justification for holding you. Habeas corpus prevents the King from simply locking up subjects in secret dungeons and throwing away the key. It’s been a pillar of Western law since the signing of the Magna Carta in England in 1215. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Founders of our nation believed habeas corpus was so essential to preserving liberty, justice, and democracy that they enshrined it in the very first article of the United States Constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What happened to habeas corpus? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In its waning days, the last Congress passed the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006. Among many ill-considered and dangerous provisions, the MCA revoked the right to habeas corpus for anyone detained at Guantánamo Bay as well as for any foreigner the government detains anywhere and labels an “enemy combatant.” This provision applies to legal residents of the U.S. as well, meaning someone who has lived in the U.S. for years could potentially be labeled an “enemy combatant” and then thrown into prison with no legal recourse to challenge their detention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How does it relate to Guantanamo? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government has little or no evidence against most of the men detained at Guantánamo. We now know that almost none of the Guantánamo prisoners were taken into custody by U.S. forces or captured on any battlefield. The overwhelming majority were sold into captivity by Northern Alliance and Pakistani warlords for substantial bounties—$5,000 and more for each person they turned in; enough money, as leaflets the U.S. military distributed throughout Afghanistan said, “to take care of your family . . . for the rest of your life.” In fact, of the nearly 800 men that have been held at Guantánamo, only 10 have ever been charged with any crime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soon after the first 20 detainees were flown to Guantánamo, CCR began filing habeas corpus petitions asking the government to explain why it was holding these men outside of the reach of the U.S. court system in what has since become a notorious offshore penal colony. Despite numerous legal victories that affirm the detainees’ right to challenge their detention, the Bush administration has managed to prevent the detainees from getting a fair hearing in the courts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What does it mean for the detainees? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June 2007, the Supreme Court decided to hear CCR’s most recent case challenging the detention of many Guantanamo detainees. These men have faced indefinite detention, sham trials, and conditions rapidly inducing psychological deterioration for nearly six years. In the coming Supreme Court term, for the third time, the high court will hear the detainees’ cases and, we hope, once more seek to hold the Administration accountable and uphold habeas corpus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The MCA extends a second-class system of justice far beyond Guantánamo to any non-citizen – including legal permanent residents of the U.S. – anywhere in the world whom the executive unilaterally declares to be an “unlawful enemy combatant.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What does it mean for everyone else? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Habeas corpus was originally meant to act as a bulwark precisely against this type of executive power. The founders of our nation considered habeas corpus the most fundamental of rights because it insured that the executive branch could not hold people without cause. Since the founding of the U.S., the writ has been suspended on only four occasions, each for a brief period of time and each in territory that was an active combat zone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By compromising this core legal value and necessary protection against the executive branch, the MCA has eroded the very foundation of our legal and constitutional framework. If we do not defend the right to habeas corpus, we all lose.\nPassage 2:\nUpdate, 21 April: Science has learned that the court order referred to in this story has been amended. The words “writ of habeas corpus” have been struck out, suggesting that the court has made no decision on whether Hercules and Leo—two research chimpanzees at Stony Brook University in New York—deserve to be treated as legal persons. The Nonhuman Rights Project has responded to the amendment, stating, “This case is one of a trio of cases that the Nonhuman Rights Project has brought in an attempt to free chimpanzees imprisoned within the State of New York through an ‘Article 70-Habeas Corpus’ proceeding. These cases are novel and this is the first time that an Order to Show Cause has issued. We are grateful for an opportunity to litigate the issue of the freedom of the chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, at the ordered May hearing.” Stony Brook has also issued a statement about the case: “The University does not comment on the specifics of litigation, and awaits the court's full consideration on this matter.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update, 22 April: The court hearing has been moved back from 6 May to 27 May. At that time, the judge will hear legal arguments regarding whether Hercules and Leo should remain at Stony Brook. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a decision that seems to recognize chimpanzees as legal persons for the first time, a New York judge today granted a pair of Stony Brook University lab animals the right to have their day in court. The ruling marks the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus, which typically allows human prisoners to challenge their detention. The judicial action could force the university, which is believed to be holding the chimps, to release the primates, and could sway additional judges to do the same with other research animals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,” says Natalie Prosin, the executive director of the animal rights organization, the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP), that filed the case. “We got our foot in the door. And no matter what happens, that door can never be completely shut again.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Richard Cupp, a law professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, and a noted opponent of personhood for animals, cautions against reading too much into the ruling, however. “The judge may merely want more information to make a decision on the legal personhood claim, and may have ordered a hearing simply as a vehicle for hearing out both parties in more depth,” he writes in an e-mail to Science. “It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons if the judge has not yet heard the other side’s arguments.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case began as a salvo of lawsuits filed by NhRP in December 2013. The group claimed that four New York chimpanzees—Hercules and Leo at Stony Brook, and two others on private property—were too cognitively and emotionally complex to be held in captivity and should be relocated to an established chimpanzee sanctuary. NhRP petitioned three lower court judges with a writ of habeas corpus, which is traditionally used to prevent people from being unlawfully imprisoned. By granting the writ, the judges would have implicitly acknowledged that chimpanzees were legal people, too—a first step in freeing them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judges quickly struck down each case, however, and NhRP has been appealing ever since. Today’s decision is the group’s first major victory. In her ruling, New York Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe orders a representative of Stony Brook University to appear in court on 6 May to respond to NhRP’s petition that Hercules and Leo “are being unlawfully detained” and should be immediately moved to a chimp sanctuary in Florida. Both animals have been used to understand the evolution of human bipedalism. (Stony Brook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosin says that even if NhRP loses the case, it will use the habeas corpus ruling to sway judges in other jurisdictions. “It strengthens our argument that these nonhuman animals are not property,” she says. The group plans to file another case—this one involving a captive elephant—by the end of the year and has set its sights on other animals, including research animals, across the country. “We have the scientific evidence to prove in a court of law that elephants, great apes, and whales and dolphins are autonomous beings and deserve the right to bodily liberty,” she says.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes. Prosin, meanwhile, says her group isn't stopping with the chimps and will also target the release of other animals.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crossroads is the site of several major hotel-casinos, including Bellagio, Caesars Palace and Bally's. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This doesn't happen where we come from, not on this scale,\" said Mark Thompson, who was visiting from Manchester, England, with his wife. \"We get stabbings, and gang violence, but this is like something out of a movie.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Las Vegas Police Sgt. John Sheahan said the Range Rover was last seen near the Venetian resort as it headed north from the shooting scene on Las Vegas Boulevard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Witnesses also told police the SUV and Maserati had come from the nearby CityCenter area, just south of the site of the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have numerous witnesses to this,\" Sheahan said. \"But what is the genesis of this? We don't know yet.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Predawn jogger Eric Lackey was on his way back to the New York-New York hotel when he snapped a cellphone photo of the blazing scene moments after the crash. Black smoke billowed from the flaming taxi, amid popping sounds from the fire. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lackey, of Forest Hill, Md., said a security officer in a yellow shirt performed CPR on a person on the sidewalk while police officers canvassed a small crowd of perhaps 15 onlookers gathering at the scene. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Police were asking if anyone was still in the vehicles and if they heard gunfire,\" Lackey told The Associated Press. \"That's when I realized it wasn't just a regular accident.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheahan said police have video from traffic cameras at the intersection and were checking hotel surveillance systems. The video will not be made public, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police said the Maserati hit the taxi cab, which went up in flames, and the driver and passenger were killed. The male driver of the Maserati also died, and his passenger was shot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crumpled, gray sports car, which had no license plates, came to rest several feet away from the incinerated taxi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people I feel sorry for are the people in the taxi,\" said Elvina Joyce, a tourist from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. \"Seconds made all the difference in the world for them. Wrong place, wrong time.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Joyce and her husband, Dave Joyce, were among the guests staying in high-rise hotels around the scene who found police tape blocking access to normally busy pedestrian crossings at the intersection. Hotel security officers and police shooed away people with cameras, and footbridges linking resort hotels were closed. Traffic around the area was snarled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheahan said the closures were expected to last most of the day while crime scene investigators collected evidence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"CSI,\" said Dave Joyce. \"There it is. Real crime scene investigators in Las Vegas.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A convention-goer, Jeff Martin, 33, of Columbus, Ohio, said he was unable to cross the Strip several hours after the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When you're out at 4 a.m. nothing good's going to happen,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheahan said the attack was not a rolling gun battle as previously described. The SUV and Maserati were stopped or approaching a red light when at least one person in the Range Rover opened fire. Several people were inside the SUV, the sergeant said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Six vehicles were involved in the crash that followed, including the taxi and Maserati. The taxi was affiliated with Desert Cab company, according to general manager Sandy Shaver. He declined to comment further. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The taxi might have been propane-powered, Sheahan said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incident marked the latest violence on the Strip since the beginning of the year.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Late Thursday afternoon, names of two of the deceased became known. The man driving the Maserati has been identified as Kenneth Wayne Cherry Jr., 27. Las Vegas attorney Vicki Greco, of Greco Law Group, had represented Cherry in speeding ticket cases and said friends of his had been calling throughout the day about his death. The deceased taxi driver was identified as Michael Boldon, Desert Cab company general manager Sandy Shaver confirmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police said a confrontation that appeared to have begun in the valet area of the Aria resort spilled onto Las Vegas Boulevard, leading to sporadic gunshots being fired from the Range Rover as the vehicles traveled north. The accident occurred near Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road, the site of several major casinos, including Bellagio, Caesars Palace and Bally's. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This doesn't happen where we come from, not on this scale,\" said Mark Thompson, who was visiting from Manchester, England, with his wife. \"We get stabbings, and gang violence, but this is like something out of a movie.

John Sheahan said the vehicles were seen pulling onto Las Vegas Boulevard near East Harmon Avenue, near City Center, then heading north. Although authorities initially said gunshots were fired from both the SUV and the Maserati, Sheahan clarified that gunfire came only from the Range Rover. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Doug Gillespie said after the driver of the Maserati was shot, he lost control of the car passed through a red light and hit the taxi cab, which went up in flames. Boldon and his passenger in the cab were killed. Cherry died in the Maserati, and his passenger was shot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What is the genesis of this, when did this all start? We don't know yet,\" Las Vegas Police Sgt. John Sheahan said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The passenger in the Maserati was taken to University Medical Center, where he was being interviewed by detectives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gillespie said there were several people in the Range Rover, but police were not saying whether they knew of any relationship or ill will between the people in the two vehicles beyond the argument at the valet station. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tourists staying in high-rise hotels around the scene found police tape blocking access to the area around the intersection. By 8 p.m., the intersection was reopened, after police crime scene investigators were finished collecting evidence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Martin, 33, of Columbus, Ohio, said he was unable to cross the Strip several hours after the incident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When you're out at 4 a.m. nothing good's going to happen,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheahan said the attack was not a rolling gun battle as previously described. The cars were stopped at a light when at least one person in the Range Rover opened fire. Several people were inside the vehicle, described as a four-door SUV with big black rims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Multiple rounds were fired from the Range Rover, Gillespie said. He added police did not know whether what kind of firearms were used in the shooting, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Six other vehicles were involved in the crash that followed, including the taxi and Maserati. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shaver said he was called to the scene to provide information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shaver also said the taxi that was struck was not fueled by propane or natural gas, as some had speculated. Gillespie said the cab exploded from the \"sheer force\" of the impact of the crash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Greg Bambic, president of the Professional Drivers Association, a taxi driver organization dedicated to assisting drivers who are victims of crimes and acts of violence, said the group plans to donate $5,000 to the Boldon family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bambic said the organization since 2004 has donated thousands of dollars to drivers who have been robbed and assaulted on the job and their families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s drivers helping drivers,�? said Bambic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The association raises money through memberships and fund-raisers and it receives donations from Southern Nevada companies that are friendly to the cab industry. Bambic said some of the most supportive donors are the cab companies themselves. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Teri Williams, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Business and Industry, which oversees the Nevada Taxicab Authority, said the agency’s patrol officers were close to the scene when the incident occurred and were among the first responders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Taxicab Authority investigates accidents involving taxicabs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams said Metro took over the investigation, but authority officers are continuing to assist. She had no further details about the status of the investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incident marked the latest violence on the Strip since the beginning of the year. Two people were critically wounded in a shooting at a parking garage Feb. 6, and a tourist was stabbed Saturday in an elevator at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. On Dec. 14, a busy Friday night at the Excalibur, a murder-suicide near the registration desk of the resort sent crowds visitors running to the exits.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I live in a little small town where we have absolutely no crime,\" she said. \"The only way we hear about things like this is on CNN or news from other places. I knew there was crime here, but I wasn't expecting anything of this magnitude. I don't feel less safe, because there is plenty of security and police to deal with it. It is very surprising to me, though. I was staying at Caesars, and I just had to come down and see it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sheahan said police have video from traffic cameras at the intersection and were checking whether the shooting might have been sparked by an altercation at a nightclub. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have a lot of pieces to put together to establish a timeline as to why this confrontation occurred,\" Sheahan said. \"We have numerous detectives checking resorts on the Strip south of this intersection.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In interviews with Fox 5 KVVU-TV, family members of Boldon said he moved to Las Vegas recently to care for his mother, who is 93.

Three people were killed, at least three were injured and this resort city was in a midst of a manhunt Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Las Vegas Boulevard near Flamingo Road -- some of the most valuable real estate along the legendary Strip -- was shut down Thursday morning and probably will stay closed for hours, officials told reporters at a news conference in the shadow of such major hotels as Bellagio, Caesars Palace and Bally’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It began with a dispute at a nearby hotel and spilled on to the streets,” Capt. Chris Jones, from the Las Vegas Robbery Homicide Division, said. There was no immediate explanation for the altercation, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PHOTOS: Las Vegas rolling gun battle NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Those involved in the dispute took to the road in two vehicles, a silver-gray Maserati and a black Range Rover SUV, with tinted windows, black tire rims and paper dealer plates from out of state, the police captain said. The Maserati sped off at a high rate of speed and the SUV followed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 4:30 a.m. at a stoplight, gunshots were fired from the SUV, police said, hitting the Maserati, which then plowed into a taxi cab that exploded in a fireball on impact. The cab driver and passenger were killed at the scene and Maserati driver was pronounced dead at a hospital. A passenger in the Maserati was among the injured. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The SUV raced off and was being sought by officials who have contacted police authorities in three states to be on the lookout for the vehicle. It was not known how many people were inside the SUV, but all were assumed to be armed and dangerous. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR INTERACTIVE: Violence in Las Vegas NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Las Vegas, which is based on gambling, tourism and convention business, prides itself on being safe for visitors. There have been some incidents in recent weeks, but nothing on the scale of this predawn shooting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tourists waking up Thursday morning faced problems getting around. Bell captains tried to direct lines of people to alternate transportation, including cab lines outside the shut-down zone. Workers in the service industry were delayed through the morning commute. Limousine drivers sought alternate routes. Casino workers coming off their overnight shifts looked for makeshift stops for buses that normally picked up and delivered people along the Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You have to go way out of your way,” Jim DeSanto, driver for a local resort, said. “Most people will understand but you have your complainers. Those people will complain when everything is perfect.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR STORIFY: Witnesses capture shooting and fire in tweets and video NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another limousine driver stood outside his black stretch vehicle. Malik Alamudeen, a driver for 24-7 Entertainment Limousines, said the traffic snarls cost him at least $500 in tips. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shooting was the talk of the area, even among the denizens of the night, such as Paul Pillat, 58, formerly of Milwaukee, Wis. He described himself as a homeless person who has been trawling the streets for years. He said he was known by his street name, Tumbleweed, and he was heading to a fast-food restaurant near the intersection about 4:20 a.m. when he heard the gunshots. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I ducked right away,” Pillat said. “I didn’t know what was going on. Somebody could have been shooting at me.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he did not see the impact, but heard the crash of vehicles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Then the ambulances started coming, it was like a stock car rally out there,” he said, adding he had come to expect violence. “It’s the wild West here. People don’t understand. They think it is fun and games. It’s not. It’s dangerous.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But many tourists were more sanguine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Inside the casinos, the hurly-burly of the gambling continued with one person, who refused to give his name, pulling the handle of a slot machine. “I’m here for the day and I’m going to get my gambling in,” he said, turning back to the machine at Bally’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Look at what happened in Orange County this week,” Gaspar Pasqualetto, of Diamond Bar, 83, said of a shooting spree that left four dead, including the gunman. He said he learned of the Nevada shooting when he arrived at Las Vegas on Thursday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Racing form in hand, Pasqualetto waved as he headed to the sports book inside Bally’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Wish me luck,” he said.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nTeenager Autumn Veatch, one of three passengers on a missing plane presumed crashed in the North Cascades, survived in rugged terrain for two days before being found and taken to an Okanogan County hospital Monday with minor injuries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BELLINGHAM — The voice on the phone was a miracle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It wasn’t another reporter, wasn’t search-and-rescue officials, wasn’t more supportive friends. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was Autumn Veatch, 16, calling Monday from a hospital in Brewster, Okanogan County, telling her father, David Veatch, and friends an unbelievable tale of survival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a voice most of them had privately feared they would never hear again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Autumn Veatch was not, as many had feared, dead in a small-plane crash in the North Cascades. She was alive, and aside from some minor burns, dehydration and exhaustion from a two-day ordeal that surely will qualify as an epic survival tale, Autumn was OK. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And she was more than ready to come home, she told her father and family friends gathered around a speakerphone in the family’s Bellingham apartment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I just can’t believe she went through all that she did,” the 49-year-old father said late Monday after driving four hours to the hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Details of her ordeal during the brief hospital call were sparse, but rejoicing was immense, said Santina Lampman, a longtime family friend in the room Monday afternoon who later recounted the call to The Seattle Times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the call, Autumn quickly explained how the small plane she’d been traveling in with her step-grandparents, Leland and Sharon Bowman, of Marion, Mont., had crashed in the rugged North Cascades. Autumn somehow survived the impact and futilely tried to pull the Bowmans from the wreckage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She stuck by the scene for some time, hoping for help, Autumn told them. But ultimately, she decided she needed to get out of the mountains on her own. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Bellingham High School junior-to-be had little outdoor training, but she did what survival experts probably would have advised: She followed drainage down to a river, then the river, via a trail, downstream to the nearest road, Lampman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities identified the trail as the Easy Pass trail, a popular but difficult hike in the rugged mountain terrain. It led Autumn to Highway 20, the North Cascades Highway, where she caught a ride with hikers to the nearest community — Mazama, in the Methow Valley — and contacted authorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Listen to the 911 call NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Autumn walked into the Mazama Store on Monday, store manager Serena Lockwood said she looked “dazed and not fully aware of what was going on.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR C.B. Thomas, the first responder from Aero Methow and another manager at the store, said Veatch arrived at 2:45 p.m. wearing a loose sweater, jeans and sneakers. He said she hadn’t had anything to eat or drink for “about three days.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She was obviously upset and distraught,” Thomas said. “She was shaking. She was certainly able to communicate her situation and kind of apologized for being upset and not speaking clearly.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She was taken to Three Rivers Hospital in Brewster with non-life-threatening injuries, but she was suffering from dehydration and exposure to the elements, officials said. She was admitted overnight and diagnosed with treatable rhabdomyolysis, a breakdown of muscle tissue that leads to damaging protein in the blood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Autumn was pretty “drugged up” when Veatch and two family friends arrived at the hospital late Monday, but she seemed happy to see them, he said. She had one request: McDonald’s. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I hear there’s one down the hill,” Veatch said. “I’m going to get her nuggets.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During her phone call home to her father, Autumn’s brief description of the crash gave the impression that the Bowmans died “on impact, or shortly after,” Lampman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities have not confirmed the conditions of Leland Bowman, 62, and Sharon Bowman, 63, as of Monday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Veatch said he had never met Autumn’s step-grandparents, but he knew that Autumn thought they were wonderful. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These people were really playing the part of grandparents,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He declined to comment on whether he knew anything about the crash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The couple’s downed plane hadn’t been found by Tuesday morning, according to WSDOT Emergency Management and Security Coordinator John Himmel. But information provided by Autumn helped narrow down the search area where the plane is believed to have crashed, officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Searching for the plane is difficult because authorities are dealing with “rocks and trees and lots of nooks and crannies,” Himmel added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Probably the most difficult terrain to try and do the search in the state of Washington,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Beech A-35 left Montana about 1 p.m. PDT Saturday. Family members notified authorities when the plane did not arrive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The plane crossed the Idaho-Washington border about 2:20 p.m. PDT Saturday, but it dropped off the radar near Omak, Okanogan County, about an hour later, transportation officials said. The last cellphone signal from one of the plane’s occupants was detected around 3:50 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During her call home Monday, both Autumn and her father were understandably overwhelmed, Lampman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think she’s just happy she’s alive,” said Lampman, a former neighbor of the Veatches’ whose daughter, Amber Shockey, has been a friend of Autumn’s since first grade. “She did joke that it was a good thing she’d watched all those ‘Survivor’ shows that she didn’t like, but her dad made her watch anyway.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Easy Pass trail has a gain in elevation of 2,800 feet, according to the Washington Trails Association, which called it “anything but easy” on its website and described one portion of the trail as “quite a climb.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trail was originally called “Easy” Pass because it was the only place to put a trail across “ragged ridges” in the area, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Lampmans were at the Veatches’ apartment at 5 p.m. Monday when David Veatch left, with friends, for the four-hour drive on Highway 20 to reunite with Autumn and bring her home. They arrived late Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The jubilation over Autumn’s survival was tinged with regret at the possible deaths of the Bowmans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I feel terrible for the family of the grandparents,” Lampman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Autumn Veatch, a former Sehome High School student, continued to live with her father after her parents divorced and her mother, Misty Bowman, relocated to Montana a couple of years ago, friends said. The mother declined to comment Monday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “She’s an amazing, witty, creative, loving human being,” said Chelsey Clark, a family friend of Autumn’s and her father. “She loves art, she’s amazing at drawing, she loves music and she’s a quirky, sarcastic girl.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even as Autumn was making her way out of the mountains, a data trail from previous activity on her cellphone was helping searchers locate the plane’s last known position. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lampman’s 16-year-old daughter provided searchers with screen grabs of times and contents of Autumn’s last text messages to her friends — apparently providing the last known cell signal used to establish a search area, Lampman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Amber heard the news that her friend was alive, “She lost it. She freaked out,” Lampman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several hours after Autumn’s phone call Monday, her friends still seemed in a state of giddy shock that she was likely to be on her way home soon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We were refusing to accept” that she was gone, Lampman said. “We never really lost hope.”\nPassage 2:\nSEATTLE (AP) — A teenage girl who survived a small-plane crash in the craggy, thickly forested mountains of north-central Washington state emerged from the wilderness after hiking \"for a couple of days\" and was picked up by a motorist who drove her to safety, authorities said Monday. But the fate of her two step-grandparents, who were also on board, remained unclear.

Rescuers narrowed down a search area based on cellphone data and typical flight patterns. But there was no sign of the aircraft or its occupants until Autumn Veatch, 16, followed a trail to state Route 20, near the east entrance to North Cascades National Park. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A motorist picked her up Monday afternoon and drove her 30 miles east to a general store in Mazama, where employees called 911.

First, the word \"verify\" more accurately reflects the requirements placed on end users of endangered wood. The Lacey Act, Johnson wrote, \"does not require any 'certification' at all per se. In the forestry world, 'certify' implies independent third-party certification, or government stamps, neither of which the US government recognizes as 'proof' of legality.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson also says she mis-spoke when she said that Gibson \"was on the ground in Madagascar getting a tour to understand whether they could possibly source illegally from that country.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I used 'illegally' when I meant 'legally' in talking about the trip to Madagascar,\" she writes. \"I didn't realize I'd done this until I was listening to the piece. I really wanted to be clear: the objective of that trip's organizers was to look into whether there were opportunities for 'good wood' sourcing, and in the end after seeing the risks, only Gibson continued to purchase.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last week federal marshals raided the Gibson Guitar Corporation in Tennessee. It wasn't the first time. The government appears to be preparing to charge the famous builder of instruments with trafficking in illegally obtained wood. It's a rare collision of music and environmental regulation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the hottest part of an August Tennessee day last Thursday, Gibson Guitar CEO Henry Juszkiewicz stood out in the full sun for 30 minutes and vented to the press about the events of the day before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We had a raid,\" he said, \"with federal marshals that were armed, that came in, evacuated our factory, shut down production, sent our employees home and confiscated wood.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The raids at two Nashville facilities and one in Memphis recalled a similar raid in Nashville in November 2009, when agents seized a shipment of ebony from Madagascar. They were enforcing the Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law that was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. But Juszkiewicz says the government won't tell him exactly how — or if — his company has violated that law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're in this really incredible situation. We have been implicated in wrongdoing and we haven't been charged with anything,\" he says. \"Our business has been injured to millions of dollars. And we don't even have a court we can go to and say, 'Look, here's our position.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Justice Department won't comment about the case it's preparing, but a court motion filed in June asserts Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband. It quotes emails that seem to show Gibson taking steps to maintain a supply chain that's been connected to illegal timber harvests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Andrea Johnson, director of forest programs for the Environmental Investigation Agency in Washington, says the Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. EIA's independent investigations have concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Gibson clearly understood the risks involved,\" says Johnson. \"Was on the ground in Madagascar getting a tour to understand whether they could possibly source illegally from that country. And made a decision in the end that they were going to source despite knowing that there was a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gibson vigorously denies these allegations, maintaining that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law. A company attorney says Gibson has presented documents to support that claim and that the recent raid seized legally obtained wood from India. He adds that the company stopped importing wood from Madagascar in 2009. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chris Martin, Chairman and CEO of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co. in Nazareth, Pa., says that when he first heard guitars built from Madagascar rosewood, he dreamed it might be the long-sought substitute for Brazilian rosewood, whose trade was banned in the 1990s due to over-harvest. Then the situation in Madagascar changed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There was a coup,\" Martin says. \"What we heard was the international community has come to the conclusion that the coup created an illegitimate government. That's when we said, 'Okay, we can not buy any more of this wood.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And while some say the Lacey Act is burdensome, Martin supports it: \"I think it's a wonderful thing. I think illegal logging is appalling. It should stop. And if this is what it takes unfortunately to stop unscrupulous operators, I'm all for it. It's tedious, but we're getting through it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Others in the guitar world aren't so upbeat. Attorney Ronald Bienstock says the Gibson raids have aroused the guitar builders he represents because the Lacey Act is retroactive. He says they're worried they might be forced to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There hasn't been that moment where people have quote tested the case. 'What is compliance? What is actual compliance? How have I complied?' We're lacking that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He's even warned clients to be wary of traveling abroad with old guitars, because the law says owners can be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The law also covers the trade in vintage instruments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nashville's George Gruhn is one of the world's top dealers of old guitars, banjos and other rare stringed instruments. \"It's a nightmare,\" he says. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970. I'm not contributing to cutting down Brazilian rosewood today.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gruhn acknowledges that the government has tried to create exemptions to cover vintage instruments. But he says they are rife with delays and to play it safe he's nearly eliminated the 40% of his business that used to deal with overseas buyers. \"This is a new normal,\" says the EIA's Andrea Johnson. \"And it takes getting used to.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Johnson defends the Lacey Act and the government's efforts to enforce it. \"Nobody here wants this law to founder on unintended consequences,\" she says. \"Because ultimately everybody understands that the intent here is to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that you've got to be asking questions and sourcing wood in a responsible way.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What constitutes that responsible way may only become clear when the government finally charges Gibson and the company gets the day in court it says it wants so badly.\nPassage 2:\nStarting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.\n", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week. NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nGAZA/JERUSALEM Israel's cabinet authorized the mobilization of up to 75,000 reservists late on Friday, preparing the ground for a possible Gaza invasion after Palestinians fired a rocket toward Jerusalem for the first time in decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial centre, also came under rocket attack for the second straight day, in defiance of an Israeli air offensive that began on Wednesday with the declared aim of deterring Hamas from launching cross-border attacks that have plagued southern Israel for years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hamas, the Islamist group that runs the Gaza Strip, claimed responsibility for firing at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Israel said the rocket launched toward Jerusalem landed in the occupied West Bank, and the one fired at Tel Aviv did not hit the city. There were no reports of casualties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The siren that sounded in Jerusalem stunned many Israelis. The city, holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, was last struck by a Palestinian rocket in 1970, and it was not a target when Saddam Hussein's Iraq fired missiles at Israel in the 1991 Gulf War. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a four-hour strategy session with a clutch of senior ministers in Tel Aviv on widening the military campaign, while other cabinet members were polled by telephone on raising the mobilization level. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Political sources said they decided to more than double the current reserve troop quota set for the Gaza offensive to 75,000. The move did not necessarily mean all would be called into service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hours earlier, Egypt's prime minister, denouncing what he described as Israeli aggression, visited Gaza and said Cairo was prepared to mediate a truce. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials in Gaza said 29 Palestinians - 13 militants and 16 civilians, among them eight children and a pregnant woman - had been killed in the enclave since Israel began its air strikes. Three Israeli civilians were killed by a rocket on Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israeli military said 97 rockets fired from Gaza hit Israel on Friday and 99 more were intercepted by its Iron Dome anti-missile system. Dozens of Israeli bombing raids rocked the enclave, and one flattened the Gaza Interior Ministry building. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a further sign Netanyahu might be clearing the way for a ground operation, Israel's armed forces announced that a highway leading to the territory and two roads bordering the enclave of 1.7 million Palestinians would be off-limits to civilian traffic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tanks and self-propelled guns were seen near the border area on Friday, and the military said it had already called 16,000 reservists to active duty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Netanyahu is favorite to win a January national election, but further rocket strikes against Tel Aviv, a free-wheeling city Israelis equate with New York, and Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its capital, could be political poison for the conservative leader. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The Israel Defence Forces will continue to hit Hamas hard and are prepared to broaden the action inside Gaza,\" Netanyahu said before the rocket attacks on the two cities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about Israel massing forces for a possible Gaza invasion, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said: \"The Israelis should be aware of the grave results of such a raid, and they should bring their body bags.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SOLIDARITY VISIT NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A solidarity visit to Gaza by Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Kandil, whose Islamist government is allied with Hamas but also party to a 1979 peace treaty with Israel, had appeared to open a tiny window to emergency peace diplomacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kandil said: \"Egypt will spare no effort ... to stop the aggression and to achieve a truce.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a three-hour truce that Israel declared for the duration of Kandil's visit never took hold. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel Radio's military affairs correspondent said the army's Homefront Command had told municipal officials to make civil defence preparations for the possibility that fighting could drag on for seven weeks. An Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment on the report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Gaza conflagration has stoked the flames of a Middle East already ablaze with two years of Arab revolution and a civil war in Syria that threatens to leap across borders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is the biggest test yet for Egypt's new President Mohamed Mursi, a veteran Islamist politician from the Muslim Brotherhood who was elected this year after last year's protests ousted military autocrat Hosni Mubarak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood are spiritual mentors of Hamas, yet Mursi has also pledged to respect Cairo's 1979 peace treaty with Israel, seen in the West as the cornerstone of regional security. Egypt and Israel both receive billions of dollars in U.S. military aid to underwrite their treaty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has vocally denounced the Israeli military action while promoting Egypt as a mediator, a mission that his prime minister's visit was intended to further. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Palestinian official close to Egypt's mediators told Reuters Kandil's visit \"was the beginning of a process to explore the possibility of reaching a truce. It is early to speak of any details or of how things will evolve\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hamas fighters are no match for the Israeli military. The last Gaza war, involving a three-week long Israeli air blitz and ground invasion over the New Year period of 2008-2009, killed more than 1,400 Palestinians, mostly civilians. Thirteen Israelis died. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tunisia's foreign minister was due to visit Gaza on Saturday \"to provide all political support for Gaza\" the spokesman for the Tunisian president, Moncef Marzouki, said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States asked countries that have contact with Hamas to urge the Islamist movement to stop its rocket attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hamas refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist. By contrast, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who rules in the nearby West Bank, does recognize Israel, but peace talks between the two sides have been frozen since 2010. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abbas's supporters say they will push ahead with a plan to have Palestine declared an \"observer state\" rather than a mere \"entity\" at the United Nations later this month.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For all the bloodshed thus far -- including at least 30 killed in Gaza since Wednesday, according to a Palestinian government website, and Israel reporting three deaths in Kiryat Malachi -- there has been little indication the situation will calm any time soon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fact, fears are rising that the opposite will hold true. Israel's Cabinet on Friday approved the activation of up to 75,000 reservists, prime minister's spokesman Mark Regev said. Also, the Israel Defense Forces reported earlier in the day that it is \"mobilizing forces\" in preparation for a \"possible ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The violence \"seems that it's beyond control,\" said Daniel Ben Simon, a Knesset member not aligned with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition.

The Cabinet headquarters for Hamas, the same building where Egypt's prime minister met with Hamas' officials the previous day, was among the sites destroyed, according to Hamas TV. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From northern Gaza, Mohammed Sulaiman said he could hear bombs intermittently falling from Israeli warplanes as well as, from the other side, rockets periodically whistling toward Israel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The situation is totally dangerous here, and it is not safe to be out in the street,\" Sulaiman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces , which has accused Hamas of turning Gaza into \"a frontal base for Iran,\" said 97 rockets launched from Gaza had hit Israel since midweek, while another 99 were intercepted by a missile defense system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The former category included rockets that landed near Israel's two most populous cities Friday. No damage was reported, but Israelis consider the attacks on its major population centers to be an escalation, said Israel's ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two struck an open area south of Jerusalem, with Hamas militants confirming they had fired rockets toward that city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alarms went off, too, in Tel Aviv, prompting people to scurry off beaches and into safe locales, witnesses said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From a seaside restaurant, Elian Karen said the rocket went into the ocean about 10 to 15 meters deep, caused water to rise briefly before black smoke began rising from the water. Within 10 minutes, people were back on the beach -- sitting, eating, playing and seemingly determined not to let the conflict disrupt their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Everyone is on the beach right now, very normal (and) no stress,\" Karen said Friday. \"We want to have a normal life and enjoy life.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rejecting the idea of a temporary cease-fire Israel had requested because of the Egyptian prime minister's Gaza visit, the militant group al-Qassam -- the military arm of Hamas -- reported on its Twitter feed that it had fired a Grad missile Friday on the southern Israeli city of Beer Sheva. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Ashkelon, about 17 kilometers (10 miles) north of Gaza, local officials said rocket strikes had increased dramatically in recent days. Such attacks are nothing new for residents accustomed to hunkering down in bunker rooms, but the emptiness of the town's marina and streets suggested the uptick had left people on edge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is really frightening,\" Shiraz Wieselhof said. \"I cannot sleep at night.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This violent back-and-forth comes after the Israeli military's start Wednesday of an operation it calls Pillar of Defense, which it launched to target those behind the high number of rockets fired at Israel over the past year.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hamas field commander Ahmad Abu Galala was killed Friday, according to Hamas officials, and Israel's military reported that fellow senior Hamas operative Kahlid Shahyer was also targeted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But despite what Oren describes as great pains by Israel not to hurt innocents -- including warning Gaza residents in phone calls and leaflets -- scores of civilian casualties have been reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Gaza City, for example, a neighbor at al-Shifa Hospital held the body Friday of 4-year-old Mahmoud Sadalah, who his father described as \"very sweet\" and intelligent. The boy is among eight children killed in the recent violence, medical sources in Gaza said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least 101 children and 96 women have been injured in Israeli strikes, a figure that does not include carnage from new attacks late Friday night, said Dr. Mufeed Mkhallalati, the Palestinian health minister. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"As a doctor, as a human, I am crying,\" a doctor at al-Shifa Hospital said. \"I can't do anything for him, because I know he's died. ...

Why?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt vows 'not to leave Gaza alone' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With its attacks, Israel is denying Palestinians their rights and efforts to establish an independent state, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is an aggression against all Palestinian people,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He cited the deaths of two babies as a result of Israeli airstrikes. One was the 11-month-old son of a BBC journalist in Gaza, BBC Foreign Editor Jon Williams said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil got a firsthand look Friday at destruction while on a tour with Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His rhetoric toward Israel was diplomatic, though his voice was halting as he struggled to get his words out after seeing a dead year-old boy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No one can remain still and watch this tragedy unfold in this fashion,\" Kandil said. \"This is impossible. The whole world must intervene, and Israel must abide by the agreements and stop the aggression.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The armed conflict is likely to further erode Israel's fragile relationship with Egypt, which recalled its ambassador to Israel on Wednesday in protest over the ongoing strikes. It also delivered a formal protest to the Israeli government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Egypt will not leave Gaza alone, and what is happening there is a blatant aggression against humanity,\" said Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His Cabinet chief noted, however, that Egypt's peace treaty with Israel is safe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"But respecting a peace treaty does not mean to stay idle or indifferent to what is going on along our borders,\" said Mohamed Refa'a al-Tahtawi, who promised \"medical, logistical and humanitarian\" support for Palestinians.\nPassage 3:\nThe visit is expected to last about three hours, and an official in Mr. Netanyahu’s office said by telephone that Israel had told Egypt that the cease-fire would hold as long as “there would not be hostile fire from the Gaza Strip into Israel.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Prime Minister Netanyahu is committed to the peace treaty with Egypt,” the official said. “That peace serves the strategic interests of both countries.” There was no suggestion that the Israelis were considering a more permanent cease-fire at this stage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tel Aviv was not hit on Thursday. One rocket crashed into the sea off its coast and another apparently fell, the ability of militants 40 miles away to fire those weapons at the city of 400,000 underscored, in the Israeli government’s view, the justification for the intensive aerial assaults on hundreds of suspected rocket storage sites and other targets in Gaza. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Health officials in Gaza said at least 19 people, including five children and a pregnant teenager, had been killed over two days of nearly nonstop aerial attacks by Israel, and dozens had been wounded. Three Israelis were killed on Thursday in Kiryat Malachi, this small southern Israeli town, when a rocket fired from Gaza struck their apartment house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a sign of solidarity with Hamas as well as a diplomatic move to ease the crisis, President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt ordered his prime minister to lead a delegation to Gaza. In another diplomatic signal, Ban Ki-moon , the United Nations secretary general, also planned to visit Jerusalem , Cairo and Ramallah, the West Bank headquarters of the Palestinian Authority , in coming days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Washington, Obama administration officials said they had asked friendly Arab countries with ties to Hamas, which the United States and Israel regard as a terrorist group, to use their influence to seek a way to defuse the hostilities. At the same time, however, a State Department spokesman, Mark C. Toner, reiterated to reporters the American position that Israel had a right to defend itself from the rocket fire and that the “onus was on Hamas” to stop it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Pentagon said late Thursday that Defense Secretary Leon E.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Denunciations of Israel for what critics called a renewal of its aggressive and disproportionate attacks spread quickly on the second day of the aerial assaults. The biggest criticism came from the 120-nation Nonaligned Movement , the largest bloc at the United Nations. In a statement released by Iran , which holds the group’s rotating presidency and is one of Israel’s most ardent foes, the group said: “Israel, the occupying power, is, once more, escalating its military campaign against the Palestinian people, particularly in the Gaza Strip.” The group made no mention of the Palestinian rocket fire aimed at Israel but condemned “this act of aggression by the Israelis and their resort to force against the defenseless people” and demanded “decisive action by the U.N. Security Council .” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For his part, Mr. Netanyahu accused Hamas of placing thousands of smuggled rockets into civilian areas, including near schools and hospitals, and firing them randomly into Israel without regard to where they landed. “In the past 24 hours Israel has made it clear that it will not tolerate rocket and missile attacks on its civilians,” he said in a statement. “I hope that Hamas and the other terror organizations in Gaza got the message.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Video NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israel Defense Forces said that within hours of the Tel Aviv air-raid warning, they had attacked 70 underground rocket-launching sites in Gaza and “direct hits were confirmed.” There were also unconfirmed reports that Israeli rockets had struck near Gaza’s Rafah crossing into Egypt, forcing the Egyptians to close it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Military officials said Israel’s aerial assaults had hit more than 450 sites in Gaza by early Friday. The officials also said militants in Gaza had fired more than 300 rockets into southern Israel and at least 130 more had been intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome antimissile defense system. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Gaza, health officials said, those who died Thursday included a 2-year-old boy who had been struck on Wednesday in the southern town of Khan Yunis, a 10-month-old girl wounded on Wednesday in the Zeitoun area and a child in the northern border town of Beit Hanoun. A 50-year-old man in Beit Lahiyeh, near the northern border, was killed Thursday afternoon when he was buried by sand after a bomb exploded nearby. Others killed Thursday included two brothers in Beit Hanoun, two Hamas members of a rocket-launching squad in Beit Lahiyeh, and three other Hamas fighters killed in a single strike in Khan Yunis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Southern Israel had been the target of more than 750 rockets fired from Gaza this year that hit homes and caused injuries. Among the dozens fired on Thursday was one that smashed into a four-story apartment building in Kiryat Malachi, which means City of Angels, and resulted in the first Israeli civilian deaths. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was just after 8 a.m. when the sirens blared in Kiryat Malachi, a largely working-class town of 20,000 about 15 miles north of Gaza, which had not suffered a direct hit by rockets from Gaza before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the top-floor apartments was home to the Scharf family, a couple in their 20s with young children. Neighbors said they had recently come from India , where they were emissaries for the Chabad-Lubavitch organization of Hasidic Jews. At the incoming rocket alert they did not rush for the relative safety of the stairwell as many of the neighbors did, perhaps not knowing the drill.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The exchanges, which have killed 19 Palestinians and three Israelis, broadened a conflict that had erupted into the open Wednesday. Israel responded to escalating missile strikes from Gaza militants by launching a blitz of airstrikes that day that killed the top military commander of Hamas, the Islamist militant group and political movement that runs Gaza. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was unclear whether Thursday's troop movements were designed to intimidate Israel's foes or to lay the groundwork for an invasion. Israel's leaders have said they are ready to launch a ground assault if rocket fire continues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early Friday, Israeli aircraft pummeled rocket launching operations of Gaza militants, the Associated Press reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The situation has all the elements and dynamics that could lead us down the road to a place we haven't been before,\" said Steve Cook, a Mideast specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"It's a very dangerous situation, and it's difficult to say what the Israelis should do.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The conflict's course from here on out rests largely with Israel and its neighbor, Egypt—the two nations that form the cornerstone of U.S. policy in the region, but which have seen ties fray in the months since an Islamist government came to power in Egypt.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. efforts to calm the situation depend largely on Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, analysts said. Before becoming president earlier this year, he was a top leader in the Muslim Brotherhood, which has close ideological links to Hamas. With his election, he inherited oversight of billions of dollars in annual U.S. military support and a U.S.-brokered Israeli-Egyptian peace deal that has defined regional security for three decades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, Mr. Morsi ordered Egypt's prime minister to lead a delegation into Gaza on Friday, Egyptian state television reported. The visit would pose an unprecedented challenge to Israel, perhaps forcing it to scale back its military operations while the delegation is there. Mr. Morsi's activist response to Israeli-Palestinian violence marks a stark reversal from the more hands-off policies of his predecessor, Hosni Mubarak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama and administration officials have been in contact with leaders of Israel and Egypt—staunchly supporting Israel's operation while pressing the Egyptians to rein in Hamas, officials said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm not going to speculate on where this might go, beyond saying that we all want to see a de-escalation of the violence and that the onus rests squarely on Hamas,\" said State Department spokesman Mark Toner. \"It needs to stop its rocket attacks.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, a Palestinian rocket narrowly missed Tel Aviv, setting off incoming-missile warning sirens in the city for the first time since Iraqi Scud missiles hit Israel during the 1991 Gulf War. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday's three Israeli fatalities came when a Palestinian rocket struck an apartment complex in the southern Israeli town of Kiryat Malachi, marking the first deaths on the Israeli side in the conflict and the deadliest single rocket strike ever on Israel from Gaza. Three soldiers were wounded in Israel by a rocket strike later Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to the 19 Palestinians killed in two days of Israeli attacks, 200 were wounded, Gaza health officials said. Those numbers seemed likely to rise as Israel resumed heavy aerial bombardments late Thursday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In much of southern Israel and in Gaza, schools remained closed and most residents hunkered down indoors, sheltering from airstrikes and rockets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly after nightfall, Israel's military began mobilizing 30,000 reserves. Convoys of buses packed with infantrymen, and flatbeds hauling tanks and armored vehicles, rumbled down Israel's highways toward the Gaza Strip.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are in the process of expanding the campaign,\" Israel's top military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, told Israel's Channel 2 television. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier Thursday, Gen. Mordechai said military commanders had approved dozens of new targets in Gaza. Leaflets fluttered from the skies over Gaza around midday, warning residents to stay clear of Hamas personnel and installations ahead of continuing Israeli attacks. Army tanks fired shells at targets inside the coastal territory. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For many Palestinians, a more supportive government in Egypt would be their first sense of change from an Arab Spring that until now has largely passed them by. Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the two retain close ties. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This time we know that this is a new Egypt—a new Arab world,\" said Haidar Eid, an associate professor of political science at Al Aqsa University in the Gaza Strip. \"We are expecting the Arab World to do something.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Israelis and Palestinians argue that it was the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt that helped emboldened Palestinian factions, including some elements of Hamas, to take a more defiant and confrontational approach to Israel that helped trigger this current flare-up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After nearly four years of calm along the Gaza border, Palestinian militants have slowly stepped up their mortar and rocket attacks on Israel in recent months. Hamas, which in recent years had acted to prevent rival militants from firing at Israel, began to join in the firing itself, in what some observers believed was a response to rival factions' mounting criticism of the group for refusing to confront Israel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enlarge Image Close Associated Press In Ashdod, Israel's Iron Dome defense system deploys against an incoming missile. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The days leading up to the Israeli attack saw a series of tit-for-tat skirmishes between Israel and Palestinian militants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel has now struck more than 250 targets in the Gaza Strip, the military said. Gaza-based militants have fired around 300 rockets at Israel since the conflict began, Israel's military says. The country's newly deployed Iron Dome missile defense system, which is partially U.S.-funded, has knocked 105 of them out of the sky, the military said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In other recent conflicts—Israel's 2006 Lebanon War, and 2009's operation against Hamas in Gaza—Israel intensely shelled suspected militant positions to soften resistance ahead of ground invasions. Israel's latest shelling has been more limited. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both previous operations were followed by several years of calm. Both also were far bigger in scope, taking a massive toll on the civilian populations, killing hundreds of civilians and scorching Israel's image internationally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The relatively lower casualty numbers in this assault would seem to indicate that Israel, for its hawkish talk, is mounting a significantly more restrained and pinpoint approach so far to operations than it has at times in the past. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That may help explain why international support for the Israeli offensive has remained strong. The U.K. on Thursday issued a statements of support for Israel.

A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nBy Alex Acquisto , BDN Staff • June 14, 2017 2:30 pm NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Updated: June 22, 2017 1:24 pm NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR HOPE, Maine — While jogging on a familiar, overgrown, wooded trail near her home on a recent warm afternoon, Rachel Borch thought to herself, “what a beautiful day.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Little did she know she was about to be attacked by a rabid raccoon she would end up killing with her bare hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the midst of appreciating the weather and scenery, she looked ahead and noticed a raccoon obstructing the narrow foot path, baring its tiny teeth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Suddenly, it began “bounding” toward her, Borch recalled Wednesday afternoon during an interview at her home on Hatchet Mountain Road in Hope. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I knew instantly it had to be rabid,” said Borch, who remembers ripping out her headphones and dropping her phone on the ground. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What felt like a split second later, the furry animal was at her feet. Borch said she was “dancing around it,” trying to figure out what to do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Imagine the Tasmanian devil,” she said. “It was terrifying.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The path was too narrow for Borch to run past the raccoon, which had begun lunging at her. With adrenaline pumping, Borch suspended her disbelief. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I knew it was going to bite me,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Figuring she would have the greatest ability to defend herself if she used her hands to hold it down, she decided that probably would be the best place for the aggressive animal to latch on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The raccoon sank its teeth into Borch’s thumb and “wouldn’t let go.” Its paws were scratching her arms and legs wildly as Borch screamed and cried. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a matter of seconds, Borch, who could not unhinge the raccoon’s jaw to shake it off her hand, noticed that when she had dropped her phone, it had fallen into a puddle in the path and was fully submerged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I didn’t think I could strangle [the raccoon] with my bare hands,” she remembers thinking, but holding it under the water might do the trick. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Connecting the dots quickly, Borch, then on her knees, dragged the still biting raccoon, which was scratching frantically at her hand and arms, into the puddle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “With my thumb in its mouth, I just pushed its head down into the muck,” Borch said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With the animal belly-up, she held its head under water. “It was still struggling and clawing at my arms. It wouldn’t let go of my thumb,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch said she held it there for what felt like an eternity until finally it stopped struggling and “its arms sort of of fell to the side, its chest still heaving really slowly.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hyperventilating and in hysterics, she pulled her thumb out of the raccoon’s mouth, “and then I just bolted as fast as I could through the underbrush,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch remembers looking back once to see if the raccoon had started chasing her again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It felt like [Stephen King’s] ‘Pet Sematary,’” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kicking her shoes off because they were soaked, Borch ran the three-quarters of a mile home to her house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch, who was screaming and unsure of how rabies affects humans, remembers thinking, “Oh, God, what if I just start foaming at the mouth and can’t find my way back?” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She met her mother, Elizabeth, at home, and together they drove immediately to Pen Bay Medical Center. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dead raccoon was retrieved by Borch’s dad, who packed it into a Taste of the Wild dog food bag and handed it over to the Maine Warden Service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hope Animal Control Officer Heidi Blood confirmed Wednesday that the dead raccoon later tested positive for rabies by the Maine Center for Disease Control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Not to scare people,” Blood said, but “when there’s one [infected], there’s typically another.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It’s important to “let folks know that just because there’s one [infected] and it’s gone now, doesn’t mean the risk still isn’t there,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Infected animals typically start showing signs within two weeks, Blood said. Humans can start exhibiting symptoms within a few weeks, she said, but often it takes a few months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s scary stuff,” Blood said. “The No. 1 thing we try to remind people of is that it’s 100 percent fatal [if it goes untreated].” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch has received six shots so far, including the rabies vaccine, and immunoglobulin and tetanus injections. She is slated to receive her last injection this weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “If there hadn’t been water on the ground, I don’t know what I would have done,” Borch said of drowning the animal. “It really was just dumb luck. I’ve never killed an animal with my bare hands. I’m a vegetarian. It was self-defense.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Her advice for others who find themselves facing a rabid animal? Borch said she has none. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I always thought of raccoons as this cute, cuddly forest animal,” she said. “I just will never look at them the same way.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch is not the only person to have been attacked by a rabid animal so far this season. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier this week, a Wiscasset man was bitten on both hands in Topsham by what was believed to be a rabid fox. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As of June 7, according to the Maine CDC, there have been 20 animals, including raccoons, red foxes and skunks, that have tested positive for rabies in 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2016, 64 animals in Maine tested positive for rabies, according to CDC data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Loading…\nPassage 2:\nHOPE — A woman who was attacked by a rabid raccoon while running in the woods near her home drowned the animal in a puddle after it latched onto her thumb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rachel Borch, 21, said she was getting ready to go out for an afternoon run on June 3 when her brother Chris told her to be careful because he had seen a raccoon “skulking” around the yard. He told her he thought it odd that the raccoon, normally a nocturnal animal, was out in the daytime. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch said she was running on a fire road next to her house when she encountered the animal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Out of nowhere, I see through the underbrush a very ferocious-looking raccoon charging at me with its teeth bared,” Borch said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She immediately knew something was wrong with the animal by the way it was acting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It was one of those moments like out of the ‘Twilight Zone’ – this isn’t real, this doesn’t happen in real life, but then it was right there and it was right at my feet,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch said she started dancing around the animal, frantically trying to figure out what to do. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There was nothing I could do, it was going to bite me,” she said. She had dropped her phone and had nothing to protect herself with. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She figured that if it was going to bite her, it might as well be her hands. She put her hands out in front of her, and the raccoon latched onto her thumb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I was screaming and crying and trying to hold it down,” she said. “There was a few inches of really muddy water on the ground – it was a swampy area of the trail – so I just took all my strength and pushed it into the water.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she pushed the raccoon’s head underwater and held it there for what seemed like a very long time as it clawed her arms and continued to bite down on her thumb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It happened so fast, but also in slow motion,” Borch said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The state’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed June 5 that the raccoon tested positive for rabies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rabies is caused by a virus, affects the brain and spinal cord and can cause death if left untreated, according to the Maine CDC. Rabies in people is very rare in the United States, but rabies in animals – especially wildlife – is common in most parts of the country, including Maine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The raccoon continued to move for a while while Borch kept its head underwater. She said she was afraid to let go for fear it would continue attacking her. Eventually, it released its paws and its jaws stopped clenching her thumb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bleeding and crying, Borch ran home and screamed for her mother to call 911. Borch’s father, Brad, and her brother retrieved the animal so another animal wouldn’t drag it off and become infected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hope animal control officer Heidi Blood said that if one animal tests positive for rabies, it’s “almost 100 percent” certain there are other animals in the area also infected. Blood said that last summer, two raccoons in Lincolnville and one in Hope tested positive for rabies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Blood said an animal doesn’t have to be aggressive to be infected; it can also act “delirious or drunklike.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said people and their pets should avoid such animals, even dead ones, because the rabies virus can live outside the body for 24 hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under Maine law, cats and dogs, even if they stay indoors, must be vaccinated against the disease. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Borch is expected to receive the last of four rabies shots on Saturday, and has been taking antibiotics for the puncture wounds on her hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You just can’t predict something like that,” Borch said. “I’m still processing it, but that does not happen and that is not a normal thing.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Share NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Want the news vital to Maine?

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nAbstract NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We measured maps of atmospheric water (H 2 O) and its deuterated form (HDO) across the martian globe, showing strong isotopic anomalies and a significant high D/H enrichment indicative of great water loss. The maps sample the evolution of sublimation from the north polar cap, revealing that the released water has a representative D/H value enriched by a factor of about 7 relative to Earth’s ocean (VSMOW). Certain basins and orographic depressions show even higher enrichment, while high altitude regions show much lower values (1 to 3 VSMOW). Our atmospheric maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 VSMOW, which would mean that early Mars (4.5 billion years ago) had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep.\nPassage 2:\nA massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold, Nasa scientists say. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The huge body of water spread over a fifth of the planet’s surface, as great a portion as the Atlantic covers the Earth, and was a mile deep in places. In total, the ocean held 20 million cubic kilometres of water, or more than is found in the Arctic Ocean, the researchers found. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unveiled by Nasa on Thursday, the compelling evidence for the primitive ocean adds to an emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, which trickled with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes, soon after it formed 4.5bn years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The view of the planet’s ancient history radically re-writes what many scientists believed only a decade ago. Back then, flowing water was widely considered to have been a more erratic presence on Mars, gushing forth only rarely, and never forming long-standing seas and oceans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “A major question has been how much water did Mars actually have when it was young and how did it lose that water?�? said Michael Mumma, a senior scientist at Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Writing in the journal, Science, the Nasa team, and others at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Munich, provide an answer after studying Mars with three of the most powerful infra-red telescopes in the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The scientists used the Keck II telescope and Nasa’s Infrared Telescope Facility, both in Hawaii, and the ESO’s Very Large Telescope in Chile, to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They looked specifically at how different forms of water molecules in the Martian air varied from place to place over the changing seasons. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Martian water, like that on Earth, contains standard water molecules, made from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and another form of water made with a heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. On Mars, water containing normal hydrogen is lost to space over time, but the heavier form is left behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When normal water is lost on Mars, the concentration of deuterium in water left behind goes up. The process can be used to infer how much water there used to be on the planet. The higher the concentration of deuterium, the more water has been lost. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ancient Mars was a warm and wet planet NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The infrared maps show that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium. The high concentration means that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet’s frozen ice caps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137m. But Mars was probably never completely submerged. Based on the Martian terrain today, the scientists believe the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet’s surface. The Atlantic, by comparison, covers about 17% of Earth’s surface. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Ultimately we can conclude this idea of an ocean covering 20% of the planet which opens the idea of habitability and the evolution of life on the planet,�? said Geronimo Villanueva, the first author on the study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Methane on Mars: does it mean the Curiosity rover has found life? Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The huge body of water lasted for millions of years. But over time, the Martian atmosphere thinned. The drop in pressure meant more ocean water wafted into space. The planet lost much of its insulation too. No longer warm enough to keep the water liquid, the ocean receded and eventually froze. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up the Martian polar caps. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We now know Mars was wet for a much longer time than we thought before,�? said Mumma. Nasa’s Curiosity rover has already shown that Mars had standing water for 1.5 billion years, longer than it took for life to emerge on Earth. “Now we see that Mars must have been wet for a period even longer,�? Mumma added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR John Bridges, a planetary scientist at Leicester University, who works on Nasa’s Curiosity rover mission, said Mars was surely at least habitable in the distant past. “Ten years ago, the story of water on Mars was an occasional flood of rocky debris every 100m years that then switched off again. We now know it’s more continuous. There were long-standing bodies of water: lakes, deltas and perhaps even seas,�? he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It seems to me that we have excellent evidence that Mars was once habitable, though whether it was ever inhabited is not clear. But there’s a chance. A life-bearing meteorite might have been ejected from Earth and could have landed in the water on Mars,�? he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The search for life on Mars will ramp up in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends its Exomars rover to the red planet. The rover will look for chemical signatures of life, perhaps emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian soil. Last year, Nasa’s Curiosity rover detected methane in the Martian atmosphere. The finding sparked intense speculation that the gas might be coming from living organisms. It might, but there is no evidence to suggest it is. Methane is regularly produced on planets through geological processes without any need for life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charles Cockell, professor of astrobiology at Edinburgh University, said: “The longer water persists on a planetary body in one location, particularly if there is geological turnover, the more likely it is that it would provide a habitable environment for a suitable duration for life to either originate or proliferate. An ocean would meet this need.�? That life was possible does not make it inevitable though. “Of course, it could have been uninhabited,�? he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR\nPassage 3:\nView Images Originally Earth and Mars had identical proportions of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in their water. But on Mars the ordinary hydrogen has been gradually leaking into outer space—the planet's thin atmosphere can be seen in this photo taken by the Viking 1 orbiter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photograph by NASA NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Astronomers using some of the world's most powerful telescopes have determined that an ocean at least a mile deep covered a significant fraction of the Martian surface four billion years ago. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This time, the evidence comes from an analysis of the water vapor that lingers today in the Martian atmosphere. A team of scientists led by Geronimo Villanueva, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, took a series of measurements of sunlight reflecting off the Martian surface and through the atmosphere, which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere's vapor. The hydrogen in water, whether it's on Mars or on Earth, comes in two varieties: ordinary hydrogen, whose nuclei contain just a proton, and \"heavy\" hydrogen, also known as deuterium, with a proton and a neutron.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both Earth and Mars started out with identical proportions of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in their water. But on Mars, with its weaker gravity, the ordinary hydrogen has been gradually leaking from the atmosphere out into space. As a result, Mars now has a higher proportion of deuterium in its water than Earth does—seven times as high, in fact. Since the scientists can estimate the escape rate that would have led to this imbalance, Geronimo and his co-authors can calculate how much water overall there once was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would have been enough, they say, that if it had covered the entire planet evenly, it would have reached a depth of about 450 feet (137 meters). In practice, says Geronimo, \"it probably would have formed an ocean in the northern hemisphere, which has a consistently lower altitude.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Their results are quite believable,\" says James Kasting, a planetary scientist at Penn State. But they probably suggest only the minimum amount of water that pooled on the ancient surface of Mars, he says. \"My guess is that the true amount of water was much larger.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reason: A paper Kasting co-authored in 2014 argues that the early Martian atmosphere was unusually rich in heavy hydrogen and that much of it escaped along with the ordinary variety. That would skew any calculations based on today's values, he says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Either way, the evidence continues to mount that Mars was once far wetter—and, since the water was mostly in liquid form rather than in the icy polar caps where it's now locked up, much warmer—than it is today. That, along with increasing signs that the ancient chemical environment was hospitable to biology, means support for the notion that life might once have existed on Mars is only getting stronger.\n", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Yuliya Talmazan NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On an August day four years ago, Swedish chemistry professor Charlotta Turner received a surprising text message that would change the life of one of her graduate students. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Firas Jumaah had returned to his native Iraq days earlier, fearing for the safety of his wife and two children who had traveled there for a family wedding. He had initially stayed behind to complete his lab work at Lund University in southern Sweden. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While with his family in Iraq, Jumaah sent his supervisor a text message asking her to remove him from the doctoral program if he wasn’t back in Sweden within a week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Firas Jumaah Charlotta Turner NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Surprised by the message, Turner, 48, called Jumaah. It was then that she found out that his family was facing a life-and-death situation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He was very sad and crying,” Turner told NBC News. “I could hear that the situation was hopeless and they had to flee.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jumaah's family had returned to visit their home country of Iraq before violence began. But while he was there the so-called Islamic State conducted a deadly offensive in northern Iraq. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Aug. 3, ISIS attacked the city of Sinjar near to where Jumaah’s family was, massacring and enslaving thousands of Yazidis — a religious minority to which Jumaah and his family belong. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He realized one day that things were getting really serious there,” Turner said. “He was very worried and he just left.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jumaah’s plan was to go in and bring his family back to Sweden, but when he arrived, most borders were closed because of a mass exodus of refugees. He also couldn’t go back to the airport. So they waited. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the situation only grew worse because ISIS kept advancing — and, at one point, came within 12 miles of their house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the phone, Jumaah told Turner that he and his family were preparing to go into hiding in Iraq’s northern mountains. She told him not to give up and started looking for ways to rescue the family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It was very spontaneous,” she said. “For me, it was obvious that I should help and bring them home.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She approached the university’s security chief at the time, who found a company that could go in with armed men and rescue Jumaah and his family.\n", "answers": ["Four years ago, a chemistry professor got a text from her grad student: If I'm not back in a week, cut me from the doctoral program.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Middleton, 28, was in the passenger seat of an Audi convertible with three male friends Sunday when the driver allegedly reached for a what appeared to be a semi-automatic gun and jokingly aimed it at a paparazzi following them, London newspaper The Sun reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The image shows Middleton, the younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, looking back at the paparazzo and grinning as her friend, the driver, reaches down and aims what appears to be the gun. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But now it appears that the excitement, which included reports that Pippa Middleton could face criminal charges, may have been overblown. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ABC News has learned that the photographer says he knew all along the gun was a fake and has been telling people he never felt scared. Even friends of one of the young fashionistas in the car told ABC News today that they have the toy gun in their possession. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Sun had reported that the Paris Judicial Police department is \"poised\" to launch a probe into the incident, but police told ABC News that there is no investigation, because no one has filed a complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Middleton was reportedly in Paris to attend a costume birthday party at the Chez Raspoutine as a guest of fashion label owner Arthur de Soultrait, also a passenger in the car when the gun incident occurred. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Pippa is a party girl. She mixes now in very high society and they don't come very higher than this group of French aristocratic sons,\" the Sun's royal editor, Duncan Larcombe, said of the three men Middleton was photographed with. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even if the flap blows over, it is a a rare misstep for Middleton, who was dubbed \"Her Royal Hotness\" and became a target of paparazzi after she wowed onlookers as a bridesmaid at her sister's wedding to Prince William last April. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was revealed in January that lawyers for Middleton sent a cease-and-desist letter around to six media agencies that distribute paparazzi photographs worldwide. The letter was said to warn the agencies that unless their photographers stop following Middleton, she will pursue legal action, which could include an injunction and legal costs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just prior to the letter being sent, the picture editor for U.K.'s Daily Mail newspaper reported that 400 photographs of Middleton cross his desk every single day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Middleton, who lives in London and works for her family's party-planning business, was last said to be back in a serious romance with her old flame, George Percy, an heir to the Duke of Northumberland, one of Britain's grandest and richest titles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Pippa has been photographed; she's been coached on how to behave,\" Larcombe said. \"If she's photographed by an unwanted freelance photographer, she smiles, she keeps her head up and she lets the lawyers doing the arguing behind the scenes. She knows much better than this.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Buckingham Palace said it would not comment on the incident, since it does not officially represent Middleton because she is not a member of the royal family. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think often by what they're not saying can often say more and I think there are some very nervous people behind the scenes right now,\" Larcombe said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think, in fairness to her [Pippa], it will be interesting to know whether she told this guy off after he'd done something as stupid as this or whether she thinks it was all a big joke because in the pictures, unfortunately for her, it does look as though she found the funny side of it,\" he said.\nPassage 2:\ngungate NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gun not real, says spokesperson. Plus, check out our brief history of other scandalous royal and celeb siblings . NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokesperson at Arthur de Soultrait's fashion company, Vicomte A, said this morning that the gun the driver of Pippa Middleton’s car pointed at a photographer Saturday was a fake. \"It was not a real gun, it was just a stupid joke,\" said the spokesperson. That will do little to assuage anger at the idiotic stunt in Paris, where a recent spate of high-profile shootings have rocked the country. What was the driver- who has yet to be identified, although de Soultrait was in the back seat - thinking when he produced a very convincing-looking automatic pistol from the glovebox of his car, and pointed it at a photographer pursuing his car through the streets of Paris on Saturday? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And why did Pippa grin as he committed this idiotic act? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charitable explanation is that it was a nervous reaction, or that the sister of future queen, Kate Middleton didn’t really realise what was going on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then again, maybe she thought it was funny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Paris police are now saying that all four of the people in the car could face arrest, and possibly, imprisonment for up to two years.

On the right she is pictured with Marcy de Soultrait, Arthur's brother NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Pippa is called in for questioning by the French police, which seems a distinct possibility given public anger over the recent spate of high-profile shootings in France, the Gungate drama could completely overshadow the Diamond Jubilee celebrations taking place this year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The shooter has yet to be identified, but, sitting in the back of the car, wearing a baseball cap, was Viscount Arthur de Soultrait, whose fancy dress party Pippa was attending in Paris. De Soultrait is an aristocratic fashion designer, and a friend of Pippa's (she previously stayed at his Paris apartment last May after attending the French Open). The party was on Friday night. These pictures were taken on Saturday as Pippa was driven to the Gare du Nord to get the Eurostar home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Contacted this morning by the Daily Beast, Royal press officers refused to comment. They told the Royalist that Pippa is a ‘private individual’ and therefore not their responsibility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unbelievably, Palace press officers, who one might have assumed would be calmly preparing a humble written apology by Pippa to the people of Paris, and perhaps an expression of sympathy about the recent French shootings, and maybe a contribution to an appropriate charity, insist it’s nothing to do with them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Royalist wrote about the challenges that Pippa faces as being a sort-of-member of the Royal Family in early March - she is more famous than Kate in some parts of the world but has no protection as she is not an HRH. Remember when a truck driver, Erik Smedhs, came up to her and kissed her after a big cross-country ski race she did for charity in Sweden? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course then, one assumed the issue was stranger-danger, not unpredictable friends of her own choosing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But this new incident highlights the challenges that Pippa faces as a public personality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Royalist’s view is that the Palace is being incredibly short-sighted not to bring Pippa into the fold officially, perhaps by making her a lady-in-waiting which was originally mooted, but was then quietly dropped on the grounds she would attract too much media attention. The Royal Family are (albeit indirectly) responsible for the fact that she is famous, and she should be given the same protection and advice that other Senior Royals are being given. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She is clearly more in need of protection than, say, Princess Eugenie, and she, and her bottom, have certainly done as much for the reinvigoration of the Royal brand as any HRH. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If Pippa does get arrested for this, which is a distinct possibility given public anger over the recent shootings in France, it will completely overshadow the Jubilee celebrations.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A self-confessed party animal, Vicomte de Soultrait was - despite his supposed 'mortificaton' - yesterday still boasting to friends that 'any party where Pippa is goes with a swing'. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So who is the French aristocrat that has got the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister in such hot water? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In fact, he is one of the most successful young entrepreneurs in France and runs the upmarket Vicomte A clothing range, which had a turnover of around £10million in 2010. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arthur went into business while doing an internship in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2004, and began selling ties imported from Italy door-to-door. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the lucrative contracts he has picked up in recent years is a contract to supply ties to the French Olympic team - but his firm is as famed for its eye-wateringly bright preppy style clothing, such as polo shirts, which are immensely popular in France and Palm Beach. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They can be best described as a cross between Ralph Lauren and Gap – but very much targeted at wealthy young people like himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hailing from a wealthy Burgundian family who have an estate in the region as well as a stunning chateau on the outskirts of Paris - to which Pippa is a frequent visitor - de Soultrait is a fanatically keen huntsman whose passion for anything connected with bloodsports is matched only by his love for the high life. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He plays polo to a high standard and has even been photographed with the Queen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is clear that his long-standing friendship with Pippa is now, given her sister's marriage, one he prizes even more highly.

According to sources, the high-spirited group did not arrive back at the vicomte's apartment in the expensive Rue de Varenne until 6am on Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following a few hours of sleep, Pippa and her friends emerged in time for a late brunch nearby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Afterwards she was driven to the Gard du Nord to catch the Eurostar home in a black Audi A5 convertible with red leather seats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR De Soultrait wore a baseball cap and sat in the back with an unidentified male friend, while Pippa hopped in the front and chatted with the mystery driver. It was on the journey to the station, at around 2pm, that the man spotted a photographer pulling up behind him on a moped in stationary traffic. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As his friends – including Pippa – smirked, the driver reached into his glove box and pulled out the weapon before aiming it directly at the photographer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is not clear whether the pistol was real or a fake – but his actions constitute an offence under French law either way. A judicial source said: 'Anybody involved in the illegal use of a handgun in public is liable to arrest and interrogation.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the gun was real, those involved in the incident face up to seven years in prison. If it is a fake, they could be jailed for two years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sources indicated that the weapon looked similar to a Sig Sauer P226, used by numerous law enforcement and military organizations worldwide as well as by personal bodyguards.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The movie’s con is that it’s showing us a secret underworld, something real that we’ve never seen or imagined, that it’s revealing how the big boys operate. But it’s not doing any of those things. “Focus” is ridiculous in every detail. It’s a movie with no truth that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it. Once that’s realized, it’s possible to take it for what it is and enjoy it, a little. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Forget the con artists, and think of it as a movie about Will Smith’s jaded charm and about how Margot Robbie looks completely different with her hair up than she does with it down. Think of it as scenes disconnected from other scenes, which are amusing for their own sake but that have little to do with each other. Then you won’t be disappointed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One scene in particular captures the strengths and weaknesses of “Focus.” Smith and Robbie are in a VIP box at a football game, making small bets with each other, and an Asian businessman asks if he can bet with them. As the stakes rise, from $10 into the multiple thousands, the businessman goes from seemingly innocuous to sinister, and the personal dynamic is fascinating. You can’t take your eyes off of BD Wong, who plays the businessman with an arresting mix of giddy playfulness and menace. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the scene itself is absurd, not just far-fetched, but groan-out-loud ludicrous. And the resolution — that is, the explanation that comes afterward — only makes it worse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nicky (Smith) and Jess (Robbie) meet cute, with Jess trying to swindle him. When she realizes that she can’t cheat a cheater, that she has hooked the Yoda of crooks, she begs him to give her lessons in stealing. He proceeds to give her a tutorial on picking pockets. Apparently, it’s all about focus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first hint that the movie is just plain silly is Jess’ audition scene, in which she picks about a dozen wallets and assorted jewelry, in a series of intricately choreographed moves involving multiple accomplices. Pretty good for a first time out. The second hint comes when we see Nicky’s operation — a massive warehouse in which wallets and jewelry are coming in from multiple sources. For some reason, all these independent pickpockets feel the need to kick up to him. Maybe they owe him. Maybe he did for them what he did for Jess, taught them how to become masters of the craft in just one five-minute lesson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Yet for all this, the nature of Nicky’s business remains vague; it seems to be whatever the script wants it be at any given moment. So, though we’re introduced to him as the Mozart of pickpocketing, we’re also to understand that he’s a swindler of international scope. Most of the film, in fact, takes place in Buenos Aires, with Nicky working a con for a major tycoon — but by this time, you don’t know what’s going on. You just know that nothing can be as it seems. That really means watching the movie waiting for the trick, which is not the same as being fooled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are some scattered good moments; for example, the disconcerting sound of race cars whizzing by outside, as two people converse in the track’s cafe. They sound like powerful mosquitoes. And Adrian Martinez has a couple of funny scenes as a socially maladroit con artist. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the emotional core of the movie, the relationship between Nicky and Jess, lacks impact, mostly because you can’t believe a word that they say, but also because Smith is not a strong leading man. Smith’s idea of playing romance is to act cool, and his idea of playing cool is to act withdrawn and serious. That means the eclipse of the thing that made him a movie star in the first place, his personality. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle’s movie critic. E-mail: mlasalle@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @MickLaSalle NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Focus NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Drama. Starring Will Smith and Margot Robbie. Directed by John Requa and Glenn Ficarra. (R. 104 minutes.)\nPassage 2:\nMusical chairs or Russian roulette? Sometimes there’s as much tense drama in the casting of a Hollywood movie as there is in the finished product. This week’s example: Focus, a caper film about a veteran con man and the young woman he takes as his accomplice. Ryan Gosling, then Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck were touted as the dapper con, while the female lead was reckoned to be played, at one time or another, by Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Kristen Stewart, Michelle Williams, Jessica Biel, Rose Byrne, Olivia Munn — basically, every working actress under 35. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since Focus conjures up a more relaxed time in Hollywood history, when the top stars radiated their golden appeal in romantic comedies about duplicitous souls, writer-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa might have dreamed of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, who paired in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1955 To Catch a Thief. Grant had just hit 50, and Kelly was 25, but their upmarket glamour and wiles made a perfect match for a movie about an aging cat burglar and the young American heiress who dares to play his game. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ficarra and Requa, the authors of this script that everyone and nobody wanted to star in, finally settled on Will Smith, 46, and Margot Robbie, the 24-year-old blond Aussie who shared Leonardo DiCaprio’s bed (and a ton of cocaine) in The Wolf of Wall Street. The mix of longtime star and minx on the rise is one tasty element in the success of a movie that approaches the modest goals and effortless allure of a 60-year-old Hitchcock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I can convince anyone of anything,” says Smith’s Nicky Spurgeon, and the man is not boasting. The con in con man is short for confidence — what he radiates, and what he extracts from his marks before fleecing them. The blithe smile, the genial but steely authority he wears like a bespoke suit: that’s Smith since his Fresh Prince days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What’s odd is that in most of his movies — from the time he sauntered into action stardom with Independence Day, through a decade of dystopian sci-fi roles in I, Robot, I Am Legend, Hancock and the misfortune known as After Earth — Smith has been obliged to glower, macho-man style, as if Bruce Willis hadn’t already patented the stoic scowl. Even in the Men is Black movies, the actor’s cool was deadpan; the smile had to be inferred. So Ficarra and Requa deserve some credit in letting Will be Will in the star’s first charm barrage since 2005’s Hitch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spurgeon (whose Urban Dictionary definition genteelly translates as “the man of all men”) runs a con outfit of 20 or so filchers who work casinos, racetracks, football games — any place where cocky rich guys can be separated from their loot. He’s on hiatus when he meets the creamy blond Jess Barrett (Robbie), who pulls a clumsy ruse that he plays along with simply from professional curiosity. Out of her league but a quick study, Jess learns to pick the pockets of smitten strangers and earns her bona fides. She’s now ready to be Nicky’s partner, and perhaps rival, in con. “Congratulations,” Nicky’s aide-de-camp Horst (Brennan Brown) tells Jess, “you’re a criminal.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR See the Most Memorable On-Screen Couples Columbia Pictures/Getty Images Silver Screen Collection/Archive Photos/Getty Images Columbia Pictures/Getty Images Popperfoto/Getty Images Archive Photos/Getty Images Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/Getty Images United Artists/Getty Images Movie Poster Image Art/Getty Images Fotos International/Getty Images Columbia/Getty Images Paramount Pictures/Fotos International/Getty Images Lucasfilm NBC/Getty Images Vestron/Getty Images 20th Century Fox Hulton Archive/Getty Images Buena Vista/Getty Images Disney SGranitz—WireImage/Getty Images Paramount Pictures NBC/Getty Images NBC/Getty Images 20th Century Fox/Getty Images Getty Images HBO/Getty Images Buena Vista/Getty Images New Line Cinema Focus Films Fox Searchlight Pixar/Disney 1 of 30 Close expandIcon 1 30 Close NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dapper-con genre, which includes The Lady Eve and The Sting, with a brief recent revival in Now You See It, demands of its audience only a readiness to fall for the flimflam, as Nicky’s marks do. The big gamble in Focus: it’s a Will Smith movie that dares to be small. It leads its stars into swanky peril with a zillionaire gambler (B.D. Wong) and an Argentine race-car mogul (Rodrigo Santoro), in games the viewer is wise to trust no one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ficarra and Requa, who pulled off a more brazen act of sex and treachery in I Love You Philip Morris, here just want to have and provide a good time. Which they do. They’ll even take an R rating for the fun of some raunchy wit spouted by one of Nicky’s pals (Adrian Martinez). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And Robbie validated the filmmakers’ trust at the end of a long casting process. Suggesting a modern Grace Kelly who wears her libido on the outside, and is a bit more self-conscious in her scheming, Robbie is really closer to a high-end knockoff of the young Michelle Pfeiffer. But that’s O.K. too: it adds to the film’s playful sense that everything, including star quality, is a con. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Except for Smith, of course. He may not be the 21st-century Cary Grant — who could be? — but as a Hollywood charmer, he’s still the real deal.\nPassage 3:\nThe character suits Smith to a tee, given that his ability to persuade anyone of anything is the linchpin of his work. Though his career began as a rapper, it took the NBC hit comedy \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" which began its six-season run in 1990, to establish him as an actor. As a street-smart Philly teen working his magic on the upscale California relatives who took him in, Smith found his sweet spot, and it started a trend — the actor charming his way into high society in \"Six Degrees of Separation\" or softening up his crusty crime-fighting partner played by Tommy Lee Jones in \"Men in Black.\"\n", "answers": ["Will Smith stars as Nicky, an established con man who takes on a new apprentice, Australian newcomer Margot Robbie's Jess, in Focus. They both love the con game, but who's playing who? Here's what critics are saying: Richard Corliss at Time is a fan. \"The mix of longtime star and minx on the rise is one tasty element in the success of a movie that approaches the modest goals and effortless allure of a 60-year-old Hitchcock,\" he writes. Smith \"takes a welcome break from glowering sci-fi roles\" and writer-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa \"deserve some credit in letting Will be Will in the star's first charm barrage since 2005's Hitch.\" Steven Rea at the Philadelphia Inquirer admits Smith \"shows some of the movie-star wattage that's been missing from his recent pics. He charms.\" There's also \"combustible chemistry\" between Smith and Robbie, but the movie just \"disappoints,\" Rea writes. \"Even if you're willing to forgive its sinkhole plotholes and farthest-fetched conceits, the film ... ultimately makes no sense.\" Betsy Sharkey, on the other hand, says this \"rom-com-con\" is \"an irresistible reminder of all the reasons we first fell for the Fresh Prince so many years ago.\" Writing at the Los Angeles Times, she notes the romantic role of Nicky fits Smith perfectly, while Robbie is \"more than holding her own\" as his match. \"The scams are Rubik's Cube complicated, but what keeps you guessing is whether the romantic connection between Jess and Nicky is real or just another con.\" But Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle isn't convinced. In a review titled \"Will Smith just stole $12 from your pocket,\" he argues Focus is \"ridiculous in every detail. It's a movie with no truth that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it.\" Nicky and Jess lack \"impact,\" partly because \"Smith is not a strong leading man,\" he says.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People who play the lottery love to dream about the things they'd do if they won the big one. Telling the boss off might top your list (not mine, oh no, not mine). Maybe a new mansion and a fancy car and a gasoline-powered turtleneck sweater (right, Steve Martin?). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We know at least two people matched all the winning numbers: 8, 20, 14, 17 and 39, and a Megaball of 7. If those showed up on your ticket, there are a few important things you should do before you go out and blow your winnings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 1. Sign the ticket. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You didn't already? Are you crazy? What if the roommate \"claims\" it? What if your significant other isn't as significant as you thought? What if you are showing it to someone, say over a beer or 10, and it goes missing? What if you forget it on your desk and you suddenly have the richest cleaning person in the U.S.? Sign it -- if you didn't when you bought it -- because whoever has an unsigned ticket when it gets turned in can call dibs on it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's also time for a selfie. With you and said ticket. It might even be a good idea to run to the drug store and buy a camera with actual film in it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then find a hiding place for that ticket.

Contact people who have dealt with large sums of money before NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And we don't mean your Uncle Eddie who says he's doing great with his online stock portfolio or a cousin who just passed the bar. Start with one experienced attorney and look for a seasoned certified financial planner. You don't want to contact more than a few people, lest the word get out before you even get the big cardboard check. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Your biggest decision right now is whether to take the cash prize (the actual money in the pot) or take an annuity (the estimated value of the cash option plus whatever interest it will earn over 30 years). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It seems like a no-brainer to get it all up front and do your own investing, but a bright financial mind will help you see if it's best to get 30 checks over time or one check.

Don't give up just because you didn't win the top prize NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Every year, a few of the people who match five numbers and win the measly runner-up prize fail to collect their winnings. So check those tickets again to see if you might have won $1 million. You don't want to be among the 2% of people (OK, it's like one or two) who threw away a million bucks.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It might be, for instance, the guy I talked to at a sandwich shop in the CNN food court who says he plays only when the jackpots are huge. He checks to see where the big winner lives and if it's not here, he tosses his tickets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR $800 million in lottery prizes go unclaimed NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But if you do get a piece of the top prize, you'll be in rare territory. The jackpot is near the U.S. record, which was a $656 million Mega Millions prize, shared by three winning tickets in March 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The $636 million estimate for Tuesday's jackpot was the latest figure as of around noon ET, updated from $586 million a day earlier, Virginia Lottery spokeswoman Rachel Buhse said. If there's one winner, and the winner chooses the lump-sum cash option, the payout would be $341.2 million. Otherwise, the jackpot would be distributed over 30 annual payments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If no one wins Tuesday's jackpot, it will rise to at least $950 million for Friday's drawing, Buhse said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.\nPassage 2:\nDec 17 (Reuters) - A last-minute ticket buying frenzy could make Tuesday's Mega Millions jackpot the biggest U.S. lottery prize in history, and odds are mounting for a winner just a week before Christmas, a game official said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prize swelled to $586 million on Monday, with another spike in sales expected Tuesday before the 11 p.m. EST (4 a.m., Dec. 18, GMT) drawing, said Paula Otto, Virginia's lottery director, who heads the multi-state Mega Millions game. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the winner chooses to take the lump sum cash option, instead of payments over 30 years, the jackpot would be $316 million, according to MegaMillions.com. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As much as 70 percent of tickets are typically bought the day of the drawing, she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ticket buying reached a fever pitch over the weekend, with 20 percent more chances sold than expected, Otto said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spending tsunami pushed the prize closer to the record U.S. jackpot of $656 million, won March 2012 in a Mega Millions drawing. The second largest lottery jackpot was $590.5 million, won May 2013 in a Powerball game. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If it doesn't surpass the record, we'll be close. It's growing a little faster than we thought,\" Otto said on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The more tickets sold, the better chance someone will match one of the 259 million possible number combinations that could land a jackpot. By Tuesday's drawing, players will have bought enough tickets to cover 65 percent to 75 percent of the possible number combinations to strike it rich, Otto said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You don't know you have a winner unless it's 100 percent covered, though,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If no one picks the exact combination of numbers that appear on six randomly selected lottery balls, the prize will keep growing until the next drawing on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've never had a jackpot this high the week before Christmas,\" said Otto, who kept mum on whether she is hoping for the drama that a Christmas Eve drawing could bring. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You like to see winners and you like to see big jackpots. I leave it in the hands of the bouncing balls,\" Otto said.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nImage caption Have a break for a quick lunch? Nestlé believes it owns the shape of four-finger bars NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even if it looks like a Kit Kat, it might not be. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The European Court of Justice has thrown out an appeal by the chocolate bar's maker, Nestlé, which argued that it owns the shape of the teatime treat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestlé has spent more than a decade fighting to trademark the four-fingered wafer shape - something that rival Cadbury had fought hard against. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Wednesday's judgement found that a previous court had been right to annul the decision by Europe's trademark group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That could bring an end to the snack's protected European status - and a saga that has proved expensive for both sides. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also takes the pressure off identical treats like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj - pronounced \"quick lunch\" and which has been around for 80 years - and opens the door to own-brand imitations at your local supermarket. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A tale of four fingers NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British and US readers may not even have heard of Kvikk Lunsj. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Norwegians, though, have national pride in the snack, and its long-running image as a meal on the go for healthy Scandinavian hikers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its chocolate has a different flavour from the Kit Kat, similar to parent company Mondelez's Milka brand. Taste-testing from the Guardian newspaper last year concluded that Kvikk Lunsj was, in fact, the superior product. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Norwegian bar has been made since 1937, a mere two years after Kit Kat - originally called Rowntree's chocolate crisp - hit the market in 1935. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For 65 years, the two crispy treats lived together in harmony - until Nestlé went on the offensive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2002, the global chocolate giant applied for a trademark in Europe for Kit Kat. There was no issue with the bar itself, embossed with the Kit Kat logo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it also applied for the trademark for the shape of a Kit Kat - or \"four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" as a top EU legal adviser put it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright EUOIP Image caption A real Kit Kat has logos - but what about the shape on the left, from Nestlé's application? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After four years of back-and-forth, the EU trademark granted Nestlé the shape as a trademark. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The makers of Kvikk Lunsj, Mondelez, also owns brands including Cadbury, Milka, Oreo, and Toblerone - and Cadbury took issue with Nestlé's new trademark. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mondelez also makes the Leo bar - another four-fingered chocolate treat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2007, the court battle began in earnest, see-sawing from one side to the other during appeal after appeal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What's in a shape? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wednesday's ruling threw out Nestlé's appeal, telling the EU trademark office it has to \"reconsider\" its decision - essentially annulling Kit Kat's claim. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case was about whether the brand had become distinctive enough to deserve its trademark - that its shape alone was how people recognise the snack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2016, a lower EU court decided that Nestlé had to prove a Kit Kat was recognisable in every EU country - and no evidence had been provided for Belgium, Ireland, Greece and Portugal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And none of the parties involved - Mondelez, Nestlé, or the European trademark office - were happy about that. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image caption Nothing in common on the wrapper - it's what's inside that counts NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestlé and the EU's trademark office appealed against the 2016 decision. If proof of distinctiveness had to be shown for every single member state, they argued, no company could ever reach that high standard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mondelez, meanwhile, argued that it was wrong to conclude that Kit Kat had \"distinctive character\" anywhere - including countries like the UK, Germany and France. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The European court threw out all those objections. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The result is that the EU's top court has now declared that it's not enough to prove that a product has become iconic in \"a significant part\" of the EU - it has to be proven across all the markets of the bloc, not just some. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is this the end of the road? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestlé said that Wednesday's judgement was \"not the end of the case\" and that it believed the EU trademark office will side with the company anyway. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We think the evidence proves that the familiar shape of our iconic four-finger Kit Kat is distinctive enough to be registered as an EU trademark,\" a spokesman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR John Coldham, partner at the UK law firm Gowling WLG, said that rather than cancelling the trademark the court decided it should never have been awarded at all on the basis of the evidence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That means the decision heads back to the EU trademark office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Assuming the EU Intellectual Property Office does not have evidence that the shape is distinctive across the EU, I would expect it to remove the mark from the register now,\" Mr Coldham said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is open to Nestlé to apply again, and to put stronger evidence in, so this may well not be the end of the road,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No-one is saying it is impossible to get a trade mark for the Kit Kat shape - just that there needs to be evidence that the shape is distinctive of Kit Kat in every part of the EU.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So the Kit Kat is set to lose its EU trademark - for now. But there is still a fight to be fought. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Triangular trials NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR European status aside, chocolate is serious business for trademark lawyers on a country-by-country basis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestlé had been looking for Europe-wide protection for the Kit Kat shape. But the trademark still exists on national level in some countries, including France, Germany, Spain and Italy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the UK considered it, however, a lengthy court case ended in a 16,000-word ruling that Kit Kat had \"no inherent distinctiveness\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cadbury, meanwhile, lost its own trademark battle when it tried to register a shade of purple. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And, back in 2006, a case involving gold chocolate bunnies asked similar questions to the Kit Kat saga. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lindt reportedly suggested its rival change their gold wrapper to bronze, and ban the red ribbon NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Swiss chocolatier Lindt applied for a trademark for its Easter bunnies with a red ribbon, which are iconic in many countries - but not all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Germany, the Riegelein company also made gold-wrapped bunnies, and the case made it to both European and German courts - where Lindt eventually lost. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And while Mondelez won the argument that you can't trademark the shape of a Kit Kat, it's sure you can trademark a Toblerone - which it owns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Toblerone's shape was registered in 1998 - but was only put to the test last year, when British retailer Poundland designed an off-brand version. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Featuring two rows of triangular bumps rather than one, Poundland argued that its copycat wasn't a trademark infringement - especially since Toblerone had changed the shape of their UK product to reduce weight. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That disagreement was settled out of court.\nPassage 2:\nLUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - A long-running legal battle between global chocolate giants over the shape of KitKat finger wafers was sent back to the EU’s trademark office on Wednesday after judges dismissed appeals by both companies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The ruling by the European Court of Justice means the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must review a 2012 decision to uphold Swiss-based Nestle’s (NESN.S) trademark on the shape of the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit over objections raised by Mondelez (MDLZ.O) of the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Luxembourg court found that Nestle had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive but also dismissed an appeal by Mondelez against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016 that had found the EUIPO was wrong to reject the U.S. firm’s complaint. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Slideshow (2 Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The outcome leaves open that the trademark agency could, while respecting the judges’ ruling, take account of other evidence — such as new proof the shape is distinctive to people in more countries — and might preserve protection for KitKat’s shape. The brand name “KitKat” is not at issue in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Proceedings have been followed closely by trademark lawyers, who see implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It has also at times featured in Britain’s Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat first marketed by Rowntree’s, which was bought by the Swiss in 1988. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2015, the Brexit-supporting Daily Express newspaper headlined a story on an earlier ruling: “End of the KitKat?”. It said an EU “diktat” might “spell the end of” the wafer bars as the “market could now be flooded with copycat confectionery”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The case has also been mirrored by a dispute between the two multinationals in the British courts, where Nestle objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury, bought by the Americans in 2010, to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.\n", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [Grooves in the ground may reveal a bird-like dinosaur mating dance] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the new research, dino sounds may be what scientists call “closed-mouth vocalizations.” Unlike the high-pitched chirps and tweets from the open beaks of songbirds, the closed-mouth sounds are low, throaty whooshes of air. A flesh sac called an esophageal pouch enables birds with proportionally large bodies — think pigeons or doves — to produce the low murmurs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A cooing dove with its mouth closed. (Tobias Riede/Midwestern University) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers figured out the common bird sound like this: First, they collected vocal data on all sorts of animals called archosaurs, which include birds and crocodiles. And, notably, the long-dead dinosaurs. Writing in the journal Evolution, scientists from universities in Texas, Arizona, Utah and Canada analyzed the noises made by many living bird and crocodilian species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They divided the types of sounds into various groups, including the close-mouth noises. Roughly a quarter of 200 birds species analyzed emitted the bulging closed-mouth sounds. Small birds, like sparrows and finches, did not make the noise. But birds with proportionally larger body types — like doves, ostriches and the giant New Zealand cassowary — do. This, the researchers say, suggest large-bodied dinosaurs may have had similar vocal abilities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Looking at the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds that are alive today could tell us how dinosaurs vocalized,” said study author and University of Texas biologist Chad Eliason in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [These chickens now have dinosaur legs — but that’s not as weird as you might think] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moreover, because not all birds had the trait, the scientists say it evolved separately in different groups of animals. It appeared in 16 distinct animal lineages, including crocodiles and birds. The scientists feel confident it could have evolved in dinosaurs, too.

(Kazuhiro Nogikazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” Tobias Riede, Midwestern University physiology expert and lead author of the paper, said in a news release. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers were handicapped in their study because vocal organs, made of soft tissue, do not fossilize the way dinosaur bones do. So it’s much easier to build a big scary creature than to reconstruct what it sounded like. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But there are a few other hints in addition to this study. Based on what scientists know about birds, dinosaurs likely did not have vocal cords — those tough membranes that vibrate when a lion roars or a human speaks. Instead, they had air sacs, and it is possible dinosaurs had a birdlike syrinx, too (an organ similar to our larynxes but two-pronged and lower in the chest). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [How to find the dinosaurs that hide inside modern birds] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If a non-avian dinosaur whooshed like a bird, with its throat puffed up, the scientists suggest it may have sounded like the most intimidating large-bodied birds of today: ostriches and cassowaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though ostriches are imposing creatures, their hoots leave Hollywood-trained ears wanting. The ostrich mating call is a low buzz, a sound about as ferocious as the gasps from a dying vacuum cleaner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That said, the sound-smiths behind “Jurassic Park” were able to call on the dinosaurs’ living cousins in a few tense scenes — just not for T. rex. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As designer Gary Rydstrom told Vulture in 2013, the sibilant velociraptors — specifically, the sounds emitted right before a certain clever raptor ambushes game warden Robert Muldoon — have avian influences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “That’s a goose,” Rydstrom said to Vulture. “Birds make pretty raspy sounds, but geese are famous for being the nastiest. You’ve got to get a goose mad and then they hiss at you, and it doesn’t take much to get a goose mad because they seem to get mad at everything.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR [The most outlandish theory yet for what killed off the dinosaurs] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For creatures that so readily capture both popular imagination and scientific study, much remains unknown about dinosaurs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The vast majority of dinosaur species have yet to be found, argued University of Pennsylvania researchers in 2006. “It’s a safe bet that a child born today could expect a very fruitful career in dinosaur paleontology,” said paleontologist Peter Dodson at the time, after he and his co-author estimated that humans had discovered only 29 percent of dinosaur genera — the taxonomic rank made of a bundle of many species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dino sounds are no exception to the mystery. It is safe to say dinosaurs made sounds, as American Museum of Natural History Mark Norell put it. But exact specifics — like certainty of dino whooshes, hoots or coos — died with the animals, 65 million years ago.\nPassage 2:\nThis post originally ran in April 2013. We are rerunning it with Jurassic WorldÂ opening this weekend. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If people knew where the sounds in Jurassic Park came from, it'd be rated R!\" laughed Gary Rydstrom. The sound designer rang me up last week to discuss his work on the Steven Spielberg action classic, newly rereleased in 3-D; when the movie came out in 1993, it netted him two Academy Awards for sound design and mixing (he's been nominated an astonishing 17 times over his career, winning seven statuettes). Though the Jurassic job was fun, Rydstrom remembers it as a tall order: He had to create dozens of distinct dinosaur noises essentially from scratch, since no one really knows what these long-dead animals would have sounded like. His solution was to spend months recording animal noises — some exotic, some not — then tweaking those homegrown sounds to create something otherworldly but still organic. What recognizable animals did he use to mix together the raptor, the T. rex, and all of Jurassic Park's other dinosaurs? Read on, if you dare: As Rydstrom implied, some of the sounds are sorta smutty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Velociraptors NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The intelligent raptors appear to have their own simple language, and it turns out that it's the language of love. \"It's somewhat embarrassing, but when the raptors bark at each other to communicate, it's a tortoise having sex,\" said Rydstrom. \"It's a mating tortoise! I recorded that at Marine World … the people there said, 'Would you like to record these two tortoises that are mating?' It sounded like a joke, because tortoises mating can take a long time. You've got to have plenty of time to sit around and watch and record them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, that wasn't the only animal element used to create the raptor noises. \"When the raptor shows up in the door window in the kitchen, the breathing noise is a horse,\" said Rydstrom. \"We used the horse in about three to four different dinosaurs.\" What about the hiss that raptor makes when it ambushes the game warden Muldoon (which prompts him to mutter, \"Clever girl\")? \"That’s a goose. Birds make pretty raspy sounds, but geese are famous for being the nastiest. You’ve got to get a goose mad and then they hiss at you, and it doesn't take much to get a goose mad because they seem to get mad at everything. All you have to do is get close to one and stick a mic near its beak and you'll get that hiss, and that's the hiss that Muldoon hears before he dies.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gallimimus NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the Gallimimus flock recalls a stampede of wild horses, there's good reason for it. \"I remember recording a female horse, and the male horse came right by her and she squealed because she was in heat,\" laughed Rydstrom. \"A lot of animals in heat make a very unique sound, and she squealed at this male because he got a little too close and she was excited about the male, I assume. And that’s the squeal the Gallimimuses make when they’re passing by, and the squeal one makes when it's getting eaten by a T. rex. One of the key elements of the raptor screams was a boy dolphin in heat, so you can see a pattern here!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tyrannosaurus rex NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fearsome Tyrannosaurus rex is one of the biggest animals in Jurassic Park, but some of its key noises came from Rydstrom's tiny Jack Russell terrier, Buster. \"The way they animated the T. rex was very doglike, especially when it grabs the Gallimimus and the lawyer and shakes them to death,\" said Rydstrom. \"Every day I would see my dog playing with the rope toy and doing exactly that, pretending like he's killing his prey.\" Was Buster's Jurassic Park cameo an isolated incident? \"No, I use my pets all the time,\" laughed Rydstrom. \"In Terminator 2, I recorded the sound of Buster eating puppy chow, and that became the crunch when the T-1000 spiked that guy’s eye socket.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"One of the fun things in sound design is to take a sound and slow it down: It becomes much bigger,\" he continued. \"That was inspired by Ben Burtt, the great sound designer from the Star Wars movies and a mentor of mine: He did the Rancor beast in Return of the Jedi by slowing a chihuahua sound down. It's one of the secrets of sound design that if you slow something down, something small, it brings out elements of the sound that you could probably never get if you recorded something big.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As for that bone-shivering, theater-shaking T. rex roar: \"The key element of the T. rex roar is not a full-grown elephant but a baby elephant,\" said Rydstrom. \"So once again, a small animal making a small sound slowed down a little bit has more interest to us than what a big animal might do.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brachiosaurus NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The brachiosaur’s singing is one of my favorite sounds in the movie because it’s beautiful, but like all good sound design, it's made from a non-beautiful source, which is donkeys,\" said Rydstrom. \"You think of donkeys, and they kind of yodel, you know? There's this pitch shift in donkey vocals, and if you slow them way down, you get almost a hooting, songlike quality. That's the brachiosaur when it’s in its splendor mode.\" And what about later in the movie, when it's in its sneezing mode? \"That's a whale blowhole and a fire hydrant.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Triceratops NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I work at Skywalker Ranch, which has a lot of cattle around, so I used a lot of cows for the triceratops,\" said Rydstrom. \"But the main sound of the sick triceratops is its breathing — this long, slow inhale and exhale — and that's actually one of the only elements of the movie that isn't an organic sound. I used this long cardboard tube with a spring in it, a reverb device that makes sounds seem stretched out and deeper and weird. So when Sam Neill puts his ear right up to the chest cavity of the triceratops and listens to its breathing, there's a lot of cow in there, but the key element of the breathing is mostly me breathing into a tube.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rydstrom admitted that he did sneak one other human voice into the movie: his friend Dietrich. \"He was visiting me and I turned on the mic and said, 'Can you make any weird sounds?' And he did this phlegmy, guttural growl. In the kitchen attack scene, there’s a close-up of the raptor slowly opening its mouth when it's about to attack Lex as she's hiding in a cabinet, and that sound is mostly my friend Dietrich doing this weird guttural growl. At the time, it felt like cheating when I would use myself or any other human to make a dinosaur sound — I felt like I was cheating the sound-design gods!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baby Raptor NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sounds Rydstrom used to animate the newly hatched dinosaur are just as adorable as the creature itself. \"It's just been born, so at first it’s really squeaky and cute, and we recorded a lot of baby animals: baby owls, baby foxes, and things like that,\" he said. And no, your ears aren't deceiving you: When Sam Neill finds out that the cute baby dino is actually a vicious velociraptor, the sounds it emits become more … unsettling. \"That's exactly right; as soon as he asks, 'What kind of dinosaur is this?' you start hearing these raspier baby owl sounds,\" said Rydstrom. \"I already knew what the adult raptor would sound like, that it would have this screechy, raspy sound, so I tried to find a baby animal that has that rasp in it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dilophosaurus NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When we first meet the Dilophosaurus, it cocks its head at Dennis Nedry and lets out an appealing trill. \"Made from a swan,\" revealed Rydstrom. \"Swans make a cute hooting sound, so the cute version of the Dilophosaurus sounds like a swan, for the most part.\" He chuckled. \"Part of the fun of doing these kind of jobs is that I had no idea what a swan sounded like before!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, things quickly escalate with the Dilophosaurus as it grows a fearsome cowl and expectorates all over its prey. \"When it's the scary spitter, there’s definitely a rattlesnake sound in there as it fans out its canopy around its head, and the raspy sounds in its voice are from a hawk,\" said Rydstrom, adding with a laugh, \"Whenever I give lectures to people about getting sounds for movies, one of the key things I tell them is that when you’re recording dangerous animals like lions and alligators and rattlesnakes, then you have your assistant do it! On Jurassic Park, I had an assistant, the lovely Chris Boyd — who's still alive — and if we needed a rattlesnake, I’d say, 'Chris, please record the rattlesnake.' And I’d record the dogs and the kittens!\"\nPassage 3:\nThis is a set of web collections curated by Mark Graham using the Archive-IT service of the Internet Archive.

Closed‐mouth vocalizations generate resonance conditions that favor low‐frequency sounds. By contrast, open‐mouth vocalizations cover a wider frequency range. Here we describe closed‐mouth vocalizations of birds from functional and morphological perspectives and assess the distribution of closed‐mouth vocalizations in birds and related outgroups. Ancestral‐state optimizations of body size and vocal behavior indicate that closed‐mouth vocalizations are unlikely to be ancestral in birds and have evolved independently at least 16 times within Aves, predominantly in large‐bodied lineages. Closed‐mouth vocalizations are rare in the small‐bodied passerines. In light of these results and body size trends in nonavian dinosaurs, we suggest that the capacity for closed‐mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs. As in birds, this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, and hence would have co‐occurred with open‐mouthed vocalizations.\nPassage 5:\nColors show probability of each branch being an open-mouth vocalizer (blue) or a closed-mouth vocalizer (red). Pies show the probabilities that the ancestors of birds and crocodiles, palaeognath birds, and neognath birds used closed-mouth vocalization. Tobias Riede NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR AUSTIN, Texas — Dinosaurs are often depicted in movies as roaring ferociously, but it is likely that some dinosaurs mumbled or cooed with closed mouths, according to a study posted online in the journal Evolution that will be published in the August print issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research examines the evolution of a specialized way birds emit sound — closed-mouth vocalization. The study emerges from a new collaboration, funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, to understand the origin and evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds and the large array of sounds it can produce. Because birds descended from dinosaurs, the research may also shed light on how dinosaurs made sound. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR X-ray image of a ring dove (Streptopelia risoria) producing cooing sounds with a closed mouth. Tobias Riede NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Closed-mouth vocalizations are sounds that are emitted through the skin in the neck area while the beak is kept closed. To make them, birds typically push air that drives sound production into an esophageal pouch rather than exhale through the open beak. The coos of doves are an example of this behavior. Compared with sounds emitted through an open beak, closed-mouth vocalizations are often much quieter and lower in pitch. Birds making closed-mouth vocalizations usually do so only to attract mates or defend their territory. At other times, they emit sounds through an open mouth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To understand when and how closed-mouth vocalization evolved, researchers with The University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University in Arizona, Memorial University of Newfoundland and the University of Utah used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of this vocal ability among birds and other reptilian groups. In total, the researchers identified 52 out of 208 investigated bird species that use closed-mouth vocalization. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Looking at the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds that are alive today could tell us how dinosaurs vocalized,” said Chad Eliason, a postdoctoral researcher at The University of Texas Jackson School of Geosciences and the study’s co-author. “Our results show that closed-mouth vocalization has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs and crocodiles. Interestingly, only animals with a relatively large body size (about the size of a dove or larger) use closed-mouth vocalization behavior.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tobias Riede, a physiology professor at Midwestern University and the study’s first author, said the association with large bodies is a matter of physics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The inflation of an elastic cavity could present a size-dependent challenge,” Riede said. “The lung pressure required to inflate a cavity depends on the tension in the wall of the cavity, and this tension increases for smaller body sizes.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers still are not certain about how the ancestors of modern archosaurs vocalized. But the occurrence of closed-mouth vocalization across birds and crocodiles — the two surviving groups of archosaurs — indicates that closed-mouth vocalization can emerge in diverse archosaur species depending on behavioral or environmental circumstances, Riede said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” Riede said. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An ostrich inflates its neck to make closed-mouth vocalizations. Credit: Ryan Mayock NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because dinosaurs are members of the archosaur group, and many had large body sizes, it is likely that some dinosaurs made closed-mouthed vocalizations in a manner similar to birds today, perhaps during mating displays. However, at this point in time, no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Julia Clarke, a professor at the Jackson School of Geosciences and co-author, said the study offers clues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “To make any kind of sense of what nonavian dinosaurs sounded like, we need to understand how living birds vocalize,” she said. “This makes for a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Future research by this collaboration will integrate information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression and sound modeling to understand the sounds that extinct early avian species, and perhaps their dinosaur ancestors, produced.\n", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vanderbilt first sought to change the name in 2002. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Starting in 2005, the university began referring to the building as Memorial Hall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To change the name, Vanderbilt raised $1.2 million to repay the United Daughters of the Confederacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vanderbilt University will repay an 83-year-old donation in order to remove from a residence hall what its leader called \"a symbol and a reminder of racism, slavery and a very, very bloody Civil War.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos made the announcement Monday, capping a 14-year effort to rename Confederate Memorial Hall. The building, which has had that name etched into the stone above its entrance since it opened in 1935, stands in the heart of the university's freshman commons, and has frequently spurred debate about the university's attitude toward an increasingly diverse student body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview with The Tennessean, Zeppos — who arrived on campus as a law professor in 1987 — said he had long been in favor of changing the building's name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a symbol that is, for many people, deeply offensive and painful,\" Zeppos said in the interview. \"And to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that I just don't think is acceptable.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United Daughters of the Confederacy originally donated $50,000 in 1933 toward the building’s construction and naming rights in order to honor Confederate soldiers who died during the Civil War. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vanderbilt previously attempted to rename the building Memorial Hall in 2002, but the Tennessee Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued to keep the original name. A Tennessee appeals court ruled in 2005 that Vanderbilt could remove “Confederate” from the inscription only after it had returned the donation at its current value. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anonymous donors recently gave the university the $1.2 million needed for that purpose; the Vanderbilt Board of Trust authorized the move this summer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Doug Jones, the Nashville attorney who represented the Daughters of the Confederacy against Vanderbilt, called the move \"a real slam on the history of our country.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “All it was was just a simple monument for the boys in Tennessee that died” in the Civil War, Jones said, adding that the name was not connected with slavery. “We think rewriting history’s just terrible. And I think it’s a very sad day for a school with that kind of reputation to be condoning that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Universities across the country have faced similar decisions as they re-evaluated the implications of their buildings' names. Students and officials at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro have spent months pushing to remove the name of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan, from a campus building. MTSU and the Tennessee Board of Regents approved the change, which now goes before a state panel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zeppos flatly rebuffed the criticism that changing the name of a residence hall would compromise the university's approach to its long and complicated history. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are not saying this is not part of Vanderbilt's history,\" he said. \"I think we teach history by how we talk about these events. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I don't think that that (name) was really teaching anyone history.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The longstanding effort to rename the residence hall took on renewed urgency over the past couple of years, as universities across Tennessee and the country grappled with the shadow of racism and slavery on their campuses. At Vanderbilt, founded in 1873 just eight years after the Civil War ended, the name change follows a series of changes made over the past year to address diversity, including the addition of a chief diversity officer to the university's leadership team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2005, Vanderbilt officially began referring to the building as Memorial Hall, although the word Confederate remained on its facade. Students, faculty and high-ranking administrators argued passionately to remove the word at a town hall on the subject last fall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ariana Fowler, president of Vanderbilt Student Government, praised the university leadership for the decision to formally rename the residence hall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This action demonstrates the administration's attentiveness to student needs and concerns, as well as sets a great precedent for advocating on behalf of those who may feel marginalized on our campus,” Fowler said in the university statement. “This is an excellent next step in the direction of becoming an institution that not only admits diverse students, but ensures their care and support — one who is eager to eliminate any barriers that may stand in the way of such a goal.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Zeppos said the decision to remove the mention of the Confederacy from the building spoke to the courage of students, faculty and staff who spoke out against it for years.

The private university announced... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Vanderbilt University announced Monday that it will pay more than a million dollars to remove an inscription containing the word \"Confederate\" from one of its campus dorms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The private university has referred to the Confederate Memorial Hall simply as \"Memorial Hall\" since 2002, but was blocked in court from changing the name chiseled on the building because it was constructed with the help of a $50,000 gift from the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1933. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the agreement, Vanderbilt will pay $1.2 million, the equivalent of the gift made 83 years ago, to the organization's Tennessee chapter. In exchange, the chapter will relinquish its naming rights to the building. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can memorialize individuals without taking sides in the bloodiest war that was fought over the divisive issues of slavery and equality that we're still struggling with today for those young people coming onto campus,\" Vanderbilt Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos said in a phone interview. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The money has been pledged by anonymous donors, and Zeppos said the school chooses to focus on \"moving Vanderbilt forward\" rather than on what projects the Daughters of the Confederacy will spend the funds on, especially in light of a new Tennessee law that makes it more difficult to remove Confederate symbols and statues from public places. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The donors and I and others understand that this donation will go to another organization, but this is a very positive step for Vanderbilt,\" Zeppos said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Daughters of the Confederacy did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 30 miles to the southeast, Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro wants to remove the name of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings. The public higher education system overseeing the school endorsed the change last month, but the proposal faces a tougher hurdle when it reaches the Tennessee Historical Commission. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the \"Tennessee Heritage Protection Act\" passed earlier this year, it now takes a vote of at least two-thirds of the commission to approve changing or removing historical markers. That's an increase from the previous requirement of a simple majority vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Calls to remove Confederate imagery from public places multiplied across the South after last year's slaying of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina. A white man espousing racist views and who posed in a photo with a Confederate flag has been charged with murder in the killings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following the church shooting, Republican Gov. Bill Haslam said he supported removing the Capitol bust of Forrest, who is famous for his exploits as a Confederate cavalry general and amassed a fortune as a plantation owner and slave trader in Memphis before the Civil War. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the defeat of the Confederacy, the newly formed Ku Klux Klan elected Forrest its honorary grand wizard, though he publicly denied being involved. Two years later, he ordered the Klan to disband because of its members' increasing violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Forrest bust remains in the lobby between the House and Senate chambers at the state Capitol.\n", "answers": ["In an attempt to bury a relic of its past, Vanderbilt University announced Monday that it will pay more than $1 million to remove the word \"Confederate\" from one of its dorms, the Tennessean reports. Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos called the inscription on Confederate Memorial Hall \"a reminder of racism, slavery and a very, very bloody Civil War.\" The Nashville university's efforts to change the name in 2002 were halted when the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued. The group’s $50,000 donation in 1933 helped build the dorm. A state appeals court ruled the building could be renamed Memorial Hall only after Vanderbilt gave the United Daughters back their money—$1.2 million in today’s dollars. The university has the cash, thanks to a raft of anonymous contributors who wanted the tie to America’s painful past broken for good. \"It's a symbol that is, for many people, deeply offensive and painful,\" Zeppos told the Tennessean. \"And to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that I just don't think is acceptable.” Yet tampering with Confederate imagery remains controversial, and a new state law makes it harder to do so, the AP reports.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A filing by the lawyers on Monday explains their push for a new trial for Tsarnaev, who was sentenced to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The filing says even on social media jurors would have seen friends and relatives posting about the 2013 bombing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawyers argue a recent Supreme Court ruling about the vagueness of the definition of a \"crime of violence\" throws many convictions into question. The legal term \"crime of violence\" was applied to Tsarnaev's actions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tsarnaev was convicted of 30 federal charges in the bombing, which killed three people died and injured more than 260. He apologized at his sentencing.\nPassage 2:\nAttorneys for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev appealed his conviction and death sentence on Monday, arguing that publicity made it impossible for him to get a fair trial in the city and that capital punishment is unconstitutional. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In court papers, defense lawyer William Fick cited a recent dissent by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer in which he said that he believes the death penalty \"now likely constitutes a legally prohibited 'cruel and unusual punishment.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the majority opinion in that very same case opened with the declaration that \"capital punishment is constitutional.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tsarnaev was sentenced to death in June for helping his older brother carry out the April 15, 2013, blasts that killed three people and injured and maimed more than 200 others. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The appeal claims that \"continuous and unrelenting publicity\" about the bombings, the defendant and his family, and wrenching survivor stories prevented him from getting an impartial hearing. It notes that Boston announced a new holiday marking the bombings while jurors were deliberating Tsarnaev's guilt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As users of social media, the jurors would have found it impossible to avoid coverage, the appeal argues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Put simply, prejudicial media coverage, events, and environment saturated greater Boston, including the social networks of actual trial jurors, and made it an improper venue for the trial of this case,\" the court papers say.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sentenced to death Read more NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But despite the dramatic news from the Boston courtroom on Friday, Tsarnaev’s fate will take years to reach its conclusion. Many of his new federal death row peers have been sitting waiting for the appeals process to work its way out for more than 20 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the Justice Department could attempt to fast-track executions in the name of public interest, death penalty experts expect the very quickest timeframe from Friday’s sentence to Tsarnaev actually being put on a gurney and injected with lethal chemicals would be at least 10 years. The prisoner’s team of legal defenders, led by Judy Clarke, have already indicated two strong lines of likely appeal: that on prejudicial grounds the trial should never have been held in Boston where the bombings happened; and that the defense was given insufficient time to mount a full argument in mitigation that might have convinced the jury to spare Tsarnaev from the federal death chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most capital cases in the US are handled by individual death penalty states, mainly in the deep south, while the involvement of the federal government in America’s most controversial judicial practice has become increasingly unusual in modern times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Although a total number of 340 prisoners have been executed by the US government since 1790, in the past 50 years only three have died: Timothy McVeigh in June 2001 for the Oklahoma City bombing; Juan Raul Garza, also in 2001, for a triple drug murder; and convicted rapist and murderer Louis Jones two years later. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the paradoxes about federal death row is that being the responsibility of the US government, it might be assumed to have a national logic in terms of the types of crimes and regions of the country in which it is deployed. But in fact capital punishment has been even more maverick in its application federally than by individual states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Almost half of Tsarnaev’s new federal death row peers were put there by just three states: Texas, which has put 11 prisoners there; Missouri, nine; and Virginia, seven. A further 13 states have one inmate each. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Very few of those individuals fall into the same category as the Boston Marathon bomber, whose involvement in extreme acts of public violence or domestic terrorism brought a genuinely nationwide spotlight on them.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nBrendan McDermid/Reuters NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An $8 billion exchange merger is in the works that underscores how the global market for derivatives has eclipsed that for stocks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The owner of the venerable New York Stock Exchange is in talks to be acquired by an upstart commodities and derivatives trading platform, according to people briefed on the matter. The IntercontinentalExchange is expected to offer about $33 a share, with two-thirds of that in stock, one of these people said. That represents a premium of 37 percent to NYSE Euronext’s closing stock price on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A deal could be announced as soon as Thursday morning, though these people cautioned that talks may still break down. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Tools NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the New York Stock Exchange, with its opening bell and floor traders, has been the public image of a stock market for two centuries, it is NYSE Euronext’s businesses in the over-the-counter trading of derivatives — including the Liffe market in London — that appear to be the main attraction in the merger talks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, was founded in 2000 and is based in Atlanta. It competes fiercely with the CME Group, a derivatives trading powerhouse that owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than a year ago, ICE teamed up with the New York exchange’s chief rival, the Nasdaq OMX Group, to make a hostile bid for NYSE Euronext. The two had sought to break up their older competitor’s plan to merge with Deutsche Börse of Europe, which would have created a powerful trans-Atlantic company with a big market share in the trading of stocks and derivatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under the terms of that deal, valued at about $11 billion, Nasdaq would have taken NYSE Euronext’s equities business, while ICE would have assumed the derivatives operations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the Justice Department threatened to block that joint offer, on the ground that combining NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq would create an overwhelming monopoly in the world of stock trading. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The planned merger of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse itself fell apart early this year after European antitrust regulators opposed the combination, on the ground that it would corner too much of the market in exchange-traded derivatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the newest merger might pose fewer problems because ICE focuses on commodities like oil, natural gas and cotton, while NYSE Euronext plies mainly in stock and stock options and derivatives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And unlike several proposed mergers, like that of the Singaporean and Australian stock exchanges, which fell apart last year on nationalist concerns, this potential deal would take place between two companies from the same country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After its deal with Deutsche Börse collapsed, NYSE Euronext was left to conduct some soul-searching. At the time, the company said that it would most likely look to smaller acquisitions and cost-cutting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trading of stocks has become a less attractive business. The New York Stock Exchange is now responsible for only about 11 percent of all stock trading, while NYSE Euronext’s electronic Arca platform accounts for another 12 percent, according to industry data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The average number of American stocks traded each day has fallen every year since 2009, and has continued to decline over the course of 2012, according to statistics from Credit Suisse. The volume of trading in futures and options, where ICE is focused, has also fallen since last year, but less than in stocks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A tie-up with ICE, however, would link NYSE Euronext to one of the industry’s fastest-growing exchanges. ICE has some of the highest profit margins in the business. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It might also reap some of the benefits that have driven a decade-long spree of consolidation among exchanges. Such companies have long sought to gain the greater scale and cost savings that come from combining back-end operations and staff cuts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the potential merger would sharply expand ICE, which despite its bigger market value is a smaller company. It has a little more than 1,000 employees, while NYSE Euronext has 3,077. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It isn’t clear whether other exchanges would seek to break up the proposed transaction. The CME Group is a candidate to express opposition. But the firm appeared to have little appetite in bidding for NYSE Euronext last year, and it may run into antitrust concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other potential spoilers, including the Hong Kong and Singaporean exchanges, could run into nationalist concerns.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nShane Bauer (2nd L), Sarah Shourd (3rd L) and Josh Fattal (2nd R) sit with their mothers during a news conference in Tehran May 20, 2010. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TEHRAN | NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iranian authorities have delayed the trial of two Americans arrested near the Iraqi border in July 2009, a judiciary spokesman said on Monday, less than a week before they were due their first day in court. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, who say they were hiking in northern Iraq and were not aware they had crossed into Iran, are at the center of a much bigger dispute between the United States and Tehran, which have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iran's judiciary spokesman said the trial could not go ahead as scheduled because of the absence of a third suspect, Sarah Shourd, who was arrested with the men but released on $500,000 bail in September this year and returned to the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Due to the absence of the third person, the court has delayed the trial time so that in between this time the third person can return to Iran or, in the event of her refusal to appear, her case be dealt with differently,\" Qolamhossein Mohseni-Ejei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Their lawyer said he was not aware the trial had been postponed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is illogical. If they want to delay the trial, they should announce it in a notification to me or to Sarah Shourd, but they didn't,\" Masoud Shafiee told Reuters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"So the trial should be held on Saturday then the judge will decide whether the trial will be delayed or not.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shourd was released shortly before President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attended the U.N. General Assembly in New York. He said letting her leave jail was a humanitarian gesture due to concerns about her health. She denied the spying charge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SWAP NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trial delay comes as Washington and other powers are trying to prod Tehran to return to talks this month about its nuclear activities which they fear are aimed at making an atomic bomb. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iran, which says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful, has said it is ready to restart the talks which stalled last year, but has yet to agree a date and has even suggested the talks should not address the nuclear issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ahmadinejad suggested in February that the Americans might be released as part of a prisoner swap for Iranians he says have been abducted or tricked into going to the United States and jailed without due legal process. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of those Iranians, a woman jailed for trafficking defense hardware to Iran, gave a telephone interview to Iran's state-run English language television channel on Monday in which she said she had been tortured. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They took me to the prison and they started to torture me in every possible way, more especially, you know, mentally,\" Shahrazad Mir Gholikhan told Press TV. She did not give any further details of her ill-treatment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said he hoped publicity about the case would help secure release of Iranian prisoners in U.S. jails. \"Iran will pursue all channels regarding the matter,\" he was quoted by Fars news agency as saying. He did not mention the possibility of a prisoner swap.\nPassage 2:\nBesides stating that the three hikers were captured in Iraq, the American military report, by an anonymous official, also said, “The lack of coordination on the part of these hikers, particularly after being forewarned, indicates an intent to agitate and create publicity regarding international policies on Iran.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms. Shourd said that she was mystified by that conclusion. The three had no idea they were near the border and had not been warned about anything, she said. “Those claims are illogical and unsubstantiated. It is ridiculous to claim that mountain climbers would be agitating along a border.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Photo NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States State Department has never suggested the version published by WikiLeaks, she said, always maintaining that it did not know how their arrest happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, confirmed that on Sunday. “We don’t know whether they had two feet on one side or the other or one foot on each,” he said. “All we know is Iran has held them far too long.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms. Shourd described what began as a relaxed overnight camping trip, undertaken by three reunited friends from Berkeley happy to escape to the fresh, green Kurdish mountains from the sweltering Syrian plains.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Various Kurds suggested they visit Ahmed Awa, a spectacular mountain waterfall where local people camp overnight. The hikers had no idea it abutted Iran, Ms. Shourd said, and twice encountered Kurdish pesh merga soldiers who greeted them warmly. The music and laughter around scores of campfires at the waterfall gave no sense of imminent danger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next day, they trekked up a dirt road past the waterfall.

Gunshots could still be heard in the Malian capital late Wednesday, hours after angry... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gunfire could be heard ringing throughout the capital, and the mutinous soldiers imposed a nationwide curfew. A flight headed to the capital of Bamako was forced to make a U-turn in the air after the airport closed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The soldiers said they are overthrowing the government because of its mishandling of an ethnic Tuareg insurgency in the country's north that began in mid-January. The rebellion grew when fighters who had supported the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi returned home heavily armed. The unrest has forced tens of thousands to flee, and has prompted fierce criticism of Mali's government. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Early Thursday, a group of around 20 soldiers in military fatigues were shown on national television crowding around a desk, facing the camera. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They announced that Mali is now under the control of the military's National Committee for the Reestablishment of Democracy and the Restoration of the State, or CNRDR. They said they were suspending Mali's constitution and dissolving its institutions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The soldiers complained that the civilian government had not done enough to combat a rebellion by the ethnic Tuareg separatists, who want to carve out a homeland in the country's northern desert. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The CNRDR representing all the elements of the armed forces, defensive forces and security forces has decided to assume its responsibilities and end the incompetent and disavowed regime of (President) Amadou Toumani Toure,\" they said, reading from a statement. \"The objective of the CNRDR does not in any way aim to confiscate power, and we solemnly swear to return power to a democratically elected president as soon as national unity and territorial integrity are established.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The West African regional bloc ECOWAS said it \"strongly condemns the misguided actions of the mutineers.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The group said it was \"all the more reprehensible, coming amidst the ongoing regional and international efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the rebellion in the north of the country.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The coup is a major setback for one of the region's few established democracies. The ousted president came to power himself in a 1991 coup, but was hailed for handing power to civilians. A decade later, he won the 2002 democratic election. The 63-year-old Toure was due to step down next month after two, five-year terms. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His whereabouts were unknown on Thursday. Contacted by telephone, a soldier at the palace said that the president's bodyguards had failed to fight the renegade soldiers, who burst in. They searched the grounds looking for him, but could not find Toure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The events that culminated in the coup began Wednesday morning at a military camp in the capital, where Defense Minister Gen. Sadio Gassama came for an official visit. In his speech to the troops, the minister failed to address the grievances of the rank-and-file soldiers. The rebellion has claimed the lives of numerous soldiers, and those sent to fight say they are not given sufficient supplies, including arms or food. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recruits started firing into the air Wednesday morning. By afternoon, troops had surrounded the state television station in central Bamako, located in southwest Mali, yanking both the television and radio signals off the air for the rest of the day. By Wednesday evening, troops had started rioting at a military garrison located in the northern town of Gao, some 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A freelance journalist from Sweden who was driving to her hotel near the TV station around 4 p.m. Wednesday said that trucks full of soldiers had surrounded the state broadcaster, where they set up machine guns facing the building. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They came and started setting up checkpoints. There were military in the streets, stopping people,\" said Katarina Hoije. \"When we reached our hotel which is just in front of the TV station, there were lots of military outside, and more cars kept arriving _ pickup trucks with soldiers on them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said: \"The situation is currently unclear and unfolding quickly ... There are reports of military forces surrounding the presidential palace and movement of vehicles between the palace and the military barracks.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Tuaregs, a traditionally nomadic people spread across the Sahara Desert, have risen up against the central government in Mali several times since the country's independence from France in 1960. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The newest rebellion launched in mid-January broke years of relative peace, and has been fueled by the return of Tuaregs from Libya who had fought in Gadhafi's army. Refugees have spilled over into four of the countries neighboring Mali due to the uprising. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thousands of Tuaregs moved from Mali to Libya over the decades beginning in the 1970s, and many joined special divisions of Gadhafi's military where they earned higher salaries than in Mali. A relationship developed between the Tuareg and Gadhafi, who claimed they had distant blood links. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When the Gadhafi regime fell last year, Tuareg troops smuggled Gadhafi family members to neighboring Algeria and Niger. After Gadhafi was killed in his hometown of Sirte in October, many Tuaregs no longer felt safe in Libya and began returning to Mali. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The government has not disclosed how many government soldiers have been killed. The toll is believed to be significant and in February, military widows led a protest, publicly grilling Toure on television over his handling of the rebellion.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.\" Except for one very lucky actor who's done both, just in separate roles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dean-Charles Chapman is currently known on Game of Thrones for playing King Tommen Baratheon, first of his name and however it goes, who took the throne in Season 4 after his brother Joffrey's death.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For reference, that's Tommen on the left and Martyn on the right: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image: HBO NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It's an easy thing to miss because poor Martyn Lannister only appeared for two episodes in the third season before getting the axe. For those who remember way back when Robb Stark had an army and was alive, Martyn and Willem Lannister were taken as hostages by Robb's army. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in a fit of vengeance, they were murdered by a northern lord named Rickard Karstark. Robb, channeling his inner Ned, was furious over the murdered children and beheaded Karstark himself. Karstark's son is still bitter toward Starks in Season 6, and now works for Ramsay Bolton.

Also, sadly, Martyn and his brother were killed off by Lord Rickard Karstark in revenge for Jaime Lannister killing his own son.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a sign of the House GOP's growing suspicions toward the FBI — as well as the influence of Donald Trump's allies who wanted the memo made public — the panel voted to publish the document only a day after sharing it with the FBI director, who was appointed by the president. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have crossed a deeply regrettable line on this committee,\" Schiff said. \"We had votes today to politicize the intelligence process, to prohibit the FBI and the Department of Justice from expressing their concerns to our committee and to the House, and to selectively release to the public the majority’s distorted memo.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes showed FBI Director Christopher Wray the memo on Sunday after Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) pressured him to share its contents with the bureau, two people familiar with the meeting said Monday. Gowdy also wanted Nunes to let Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein see the memo too, but he did not join them Sunday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In their meeting, Nunes told Wray he could flag any factual errors, national security concerns or material that could put FBI sources at risk, according to the people familiar with the meeting. Schiff said Wray told him his concerns with the memo were not alleviated just because he reviewed it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The review did not satisfy, I think, either the bureau or [DOJ's] concerns,\" Schiff said. \"The director of the FBI asked for the opportunity to come before the committee and express those concerns.\" He said Republicans also formally confirmed on Monday that they are probing conduct by senior officials at the Department of Justice and FBI. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Committee Republicans did agree to share Democrats' competing memo with the rest of the House, which they called a precursor to potentially releasing it publicly. Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) told reporters the Democratic memo \"should be\" released after House members have time to review it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump now has five days to either object to the committee's request or clear the way for the memo's release. The White House said earlier on Monday that no decision would be made until lawmakers voted.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It will be subjected to appropriate and serious review before a decision is made. The President strongly favors transparency for the American people and has urged the Executive Branch to cooperate with Congress to the fullest extent appropriate,\" said White House lawyer Ty Cobb in a statement Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three people who have seen the memo told POLITICO recently that it accuses senior FBI officials of abusing a classified surveillance program, known as FISA, to spy on a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. Obtaining a warrant under FISA requires the FBI to present an application to a court with evidence that indicates the target is acting on behalf of a foreign power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The GOP has complained that the FBI included in its evidence material culled from a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele that described illicit connections between Trump and Russia. Steele compiled the dossier in 2016 on behalf of research firm Fusion GPS, which was being paid by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New York Times reported Monday that the memo also reveals that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein approved an application to extend the surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in early 2017. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, helped craft the memo and has championed its public release, he said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he believed the FBI should see the memo before it comes out. He also said it shouldn't be used to interfere with Mueller's probe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I told my Republican colleagues, ‘Leave him the hell alone,’ and that’s still my advice,” Gowdy said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), a member of the House intelligence committee and a former CIA officer, said he was not concerned about a Justice Department warning that releasing the memo without DOJ review could jeopardize national security. \"I spent most of my adult life protecting sources and methods. I’m going to continue doing that,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rachael Bade contributed to this report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR\n", "answers": ["It's all up to President Trump now.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The news was first reported by Bloomberg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The move, which is not finalized and could change, according to the source, comes as the United States and China remain locked in a trade war. Talks between US and Chinese officials have done little to ease tensions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States has already imposed 25% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion. China immediately responded with its own tariffs on US goods worth $34 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A second round of tariffs on products worth $16 billion could take effect as soon as this week.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are having private conversations as they look for ways to reengage in negotiations, according to the people who spoke about the deliberations on condition of anonymity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They cautioned that a specific timetable, the issues to be discussed and the format for talks aren’t finalized, but added there was agreement among the principals that more discussions need to take place. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Negotiations to resolve the dispute have been stalled for weeks, with both sides refusing to budge. High-level U.S. talks on the Trump administration’s trade posture toward China are taking place this week, according to a third person who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. stocks closed higher as the prospects for an easing in trade tensions lifted industrial shares, with Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc. and 3M Co. all adding more than 1 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The next wave of U.S. tariffs is set to kick in as soon as Wednesday, with the possible imposition of duties on another $16 billion of Chinese imports. The implementation could be delayed for weeks as the administration works out the details of which products it will target. Officials in Beijing have vowed to respond with the same amount of tariffs on U.S. products. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One person familiar with the internal deliberations said the U.S. is trying to secure certain concessions and if China agrees, it is possible the U.S. would back off additional tariffs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Complicating Mnuchin’s efforts is a harder line taken by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has jurisdiction over the U.S.’s 301 investigation that sparked the tariffs. That case concluded China was stealing American technology and tariffs were needed to offset the damage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A U.S. Treasury spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Chronic Problem’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. and Chinese officials have given little recent indication in public that a restart to negotiations might be in the offing. Lighthizer said last week that trade tensions with China are a “chronic problem,” while China’s representative at the World Trade Organization accused the U.S. of “extortion.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two sides held three rounds of formal talks, beginning with a delegation to Beijing led by Mnuchin in May. After Liu visited Washington later that month, the nations released a joint statement pledging to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, among other things. But within days, President Donald Trump himself backed away from the deal, saying talks would “probably have to use a different structure.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Negotiations broke off after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports this month, a move the Chinese said would void any promises they’d made in negotiations. Beijing responded in kind with its own tariffs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump’s mission to reduce the U.S. trade deficit via the threat of tariffs has brought him into conflict with China as well as U.S. allies, roiling financial markets and raising fears of a global trade war the International Monetary Fund has warned may undermine the strongest economic upswing in years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ZTE Deal NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Chinese and U.S. officials have struggled to find a starting place for a new round of talks. After taking a hard line on Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp., the Trump administration this month finished a deal that allowed the company to stay in business. Trump said the pact was a personal favor to Chinese President Xi Jinping. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In exchange for the U.S. letting ZTE survive, Chinese regulators were expected to approve a deal between San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. and rival chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV, based in Eindhoven, Netherlands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mnuchin was among the Cabinet officials involved in a last-minute effort early last week to get the Qualcomm-NXP deal approved before the companies vowed to walk away from it on July 25, the people said. Mnuchin’s efforts were unsuccessful and Qualcomm scrapped its $44 billion bid for NXP. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The people familiar with the U.S.-China dispute said the U.S. has privately expressed dismay to the highest levels of the Chinese government that the deal fell through. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Politburo Shift NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a sign the trade standoff is reverberating through Chinese politics, the Politburo signaled Tuesday that policy makers will focus more on supporting economic growth amid risks from a campaign to reduce debt and the dispute with Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The communique, which followed a meeting of the country’s 25 most senior leaders led by Xi, said the nation’s campaign to reduce leverage will continue at a measured pace while improving economic policies to make them more forward-looking, flexible and effective in the second half of 2018.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nSony had an event today and as expected, it introduced the PlayStation 4. The next-gen platform is designed to shift focus from the living room to the gamer, Sony said, and overall, PlayStation’s approach is meant to make it possible for gamers to play wherever they want, whenever they want. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PS4 lead system architect Mark Cerny talked about how the evolution of the PS4 came about, saying it began five years ago, earlier on in the life of the PS3. The PS3 was a first step, which was designed to connect to a variety of services, but it was limited because of how early it launched in that world, Cerny said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Much less value is found today in blast processing or a system-on-a-chip,” Cerny said. He suggested tech could interfere with design innovation. The tech remains important, he stressed, but the idea was to create a platform that was all about experience. Sound familiar? That’s because it’s a tune Apple and Steve Jobs started playing years ago when they realized the spec race was a nonstarter in the mobile phone world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “By game creators, for game creators. It is a powerful and accessible system,” Cerny said on stage, suggesting that this time around there was a strong emphasis on ease of development, hence the use of a standard x86 PC CPU. The GPU is designed for use with “practical tasks,” he said, with the overall goal of making development a painless experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Essentially, the PS4 is an advanced, x86-based personal computer, which means that it should be easy for developers to build. All of this is clearly an answer to a major complaint from studios about the previous generation, which was infamously tricky to master from a software perspective. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sony also unveiled a redesigned DualShock 4 controller, which has the Vita-style touchpad depicted in rumors, ad works with a 3D “stereo” camera accessory to track its movements in a loose approximation of what’s possible with Microsoft’s Xbox Kinect. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The hardware is clearly also borrowing some tricks from mobile games. It has save states that allow users to quickly freeze and resume gameplay, without having to save just by switching on and off the console. There’s also background downloading, which allows digital titles to be played before they’re even completely on your local drive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Social is another key tentpole for the PS4, according to Cerny. He described a new function that allows you to quickly pause and upload gameplay videos as easily as you might have done with static screenshots in the past. There’s also spectator functionality for watching “celebrities” gaming, something which seems to have been borrowed from Twitter’s success with famous members. Networking will also be based around real names and profile pictures, instead of strictly on gamer tags and avatars, too, and all of this will plug into mobile apps to help gamers stay in touch.\nPassage 2:\nIt's been seven years since the giant, boxy, expensive, hugely-fun and hyped PS3 first arrived. Seven years is a long time. But the next expensive, gorgeous era of gaming is here: the PlayStation 4. Everything looks better, yes, but it's definitely more of the same. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The PS4, arriving in stores \"Holiday 2013,\" is still very much a PC in terms of guts: an x86 processor, an 8-core combined CPU/GPU, (we're not sure of exactly which one), and 8 GB of unified GDDR5 memory (versus the PS3's 512 megabytes). And for those of you who worry about storage—don't, as the PS4 will have a local HDD (no word if there will be any solid state action). What does that mean for your eyeballs? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A live demo of generic Unreal Engine 4 fiery destruction looked fantastic and fluid, at least on par with a high-end PC from today. A look at the next Killzone title was even more impressive, though we don't want to get our hopes up too much about what's pre-rendered here and what isn't. If it is, lighting effects look absolutely phenomenal, with better flames, glare, and shadows than anything on any console. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that's the idea, right? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cityscape scenes and view distance are pleasantly massive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Overall—and this is based only on demos projected onto a screen, not a real game on a real TV in your real home—the graphics are fantastic, but not of an OH MY HELL, nothing-else-like-it-even-close leap. Like, say, the first time you ever saw Sonic Adventure. A demo of Driveclub for PS4 wasn't appreciably better than the visuals you'd see on the latest Gran Turismo. I'd actually say it looked... the exact same. But we're not disappointed—there are absolutely scenes we've seen so far that could've only been pre-rendered on a PS3 or Xbox 360 and this thing isn't even out yet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR face NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A demo by Quantic Dream showing off realtime facial detail running straight off the PS4 was brilliant. And it was just a demo. Imagine this tech behind the team who made LA Noire. On the other hand, it's just a single guy's head floating in space, and a demo, at that. But his skin looked real, man. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A demo of Capcom's PS4 \"Panta Rhei\" engine looked like a mix between pre-rendered PS3-splendid, and current-gen PC smooth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spectacular lighting and facial graphics, once again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some bad news: no native PS3 backwards compatibility. But! You'll have PlayStation Cloud, permitting streaming access to old titles without the need for discs. Sony is frustratingly mum on how PlayStation Cloud will actually work, though. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The DualShock makes a return as well—the DualShock 4—sharing the same general design as its predecessors. But it'll now share a touchpad in the middle, a share button, a headphone jack, and perhaps most importantly, a light bar that'll track movement with a PlayStation Move-style controller. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That means movement gestures baked right into your hand—no need for a separate wand to wave around. Just one controller. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There's also very impressive stuff going on in the background—games will be \"instantly\" bootable from sleep, and a secondary processor will handle downloading games in the background, giving you the ability to actually play games while they're being transferred from Sony's servers to your PS4. This will be nice for anyone absolutely sick of PS3's historically bad download wait times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A dedicated video-processing chip will let you stream video from your gaming session without leaving your session, sharable straight from a social-oriented button on your controller. Your friends will actually be able ot watch you play from their won couches, remotely offering tips and banter. Or hell: ask a friend who's just better than you to take over your game from their controller and beat that horrible boss. UStream integration will mean your performance can be a public one if you'd like, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All the usual streaming video apps—Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, et al—will be there. Just like PS3. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new social gaming interface looks decent, but Sony is pushing \"social integration\" pretty hard here (well beyond finding strangers to kill), and it's questionable how much anyone really wants a social network on their phones and tablets built around gaming. We already have too many. Luckily, Facebook will be integrated inside the PS4, connecting with the PlayStation Network to fill it out with the online life you've already been building, rather than tediously starting from scratch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Personalization is an interesting emphasis—Sony says it'll study your downloading and playing habits to actually predict the next titles you'll want and download them ahead of time. Unless that's very smart, it's going to be very annoying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Remote play—continuing where you left off on another screen—will be another bullet point for the PS4. Expectedly, the Vita will be the go-to small-screen, with PS4 titles streaming straight to the Vita's 5-inch display. Unfortunately, it looks like it'll have to be wired, but Sony says the \"goal\" will be every single PS4 title playable on Vita. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So what does it look like we have here (or will have) in the PS4? The PS3... but... more. Where the PS3 was fast, this is faster, pretty becomes prettier, everything a little expanded. It's a stiffer drink you've had before. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of course, no word on how much this thing will cost, and to our disappointment and exasperation, we have no idea what the console will look like. Maybe it's a pyramid. Bloody hell, Sony.\n", "answers": ["Sony today unveiled its next-generation gaming system, PlayStation 4, saying the console will be part of a new ecosystem focused on hardware, software, and \"the fastest, most powerful gaming network.\" The new console is the Japanese electronics giant's first major game machine since the PlayStation 3 went on sale in 2006.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers from UC Berkeley pieced together the brain patterns of its subjects as they watched YouTube videos, and then produced a YouTube video of their own with the results. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What emerged was like a Surrealist painting: a blurry, dream-like interpretation of reality (see video below). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the experiment, subjectsthe researchers themselvesspent hours lying still inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, watching two sets of movie trailers. The MRI machine recorded the amount of blood flowing through the visual cortex, the part of the brain that processes visual information. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the first set, recorded brain activity was fed into a computer to program a \"movie reconstruction algorithm,\" which matched neural activity to what was taking place in the video. The algorithm thus learned to associate certain neural patterns with dynamic informationshapes, images, soundsagainst 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Subjects then watched the same set of trailers as the algorithm pieced together a video based on brain activity recorded by the MRI. The result is a continuous, if abstract, reconstruction of the actual videos.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Researchers from UC Berkeley were able to reconstruct YouTube videos from viewers' brain activity -- a feat that might one day offer a glimpse into our dreams, memories and even fantasies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a major leap toward reconstructing internal imagery,\" said Jack Gallant, professor of psychology and coauthor of a study published today in Current Biology. \"We are opening a window into the movies in our minds.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gallant's coauthors acted as study subjects, watching YouTube videos inside a magnetic resonance imaging machine for several hours at a time. The team then used the brain imaging data to develop a computer model that matched features of the videos -- like colors, shapes and movements -- with patterns of brain activity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Once we had this model built, we could read brain activity for that subject and run it backwards through the model to try to uncover what the viewer saw,\" said Gallant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Subtle changes in blood flow to visual areas of the brain, measured by functional MRI, predicted what was on the screen at the time -- whether it was Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau or an airplane. The reconstructed videos are blurry because they layer all the YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity pattern. The result is a haunting, almost dream-like version of the video as seen by the mind's eye. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers say the technology could one day be used to broadcast imagery -- the scenes that play out inside our minds independent from vision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If you can decode movies people saw, you might be able to decode things in the brain that are movie-like but have no real-world analog, like dreams,\" Gallant said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The brain activity measured in this study is just a fraction of the activity that lets us see moving images. Other, more complex areas help us interpret the content of those images -- distinguish faces from lifeless objects, for example. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The brain isn't just one big blob of tissue. It actually consists of dozens, even hundreds of modules, each of which does a different thing,\" said Gallant. \"We hope to look at more visual modules, and try to build models for every single part of visual system.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More models, Gallant said, mean better resolution. It also means a ton more data to analyze. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We need really big computers,\" Gallant said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shinji Nishimoto, a neuroscientist in Gallant's lab and the study's lead author, said the results shed light on how the brain understands and processes visual experiences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We need to know how the brain works in naturalistic conditions,\" Nishimoto said in a statement. \"For that, we need to first understand how the brain works while we are watching movies.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether the technology could also be used to watch people's dreams or memories -- even intentions -- depends on how close those abstract visual experiences are to the real thing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We simply don't know at this point. But it's our next line of research,\" said Gallant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If the technology could be used to broadcast imagery, it could one day allow people who are paralyzed to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements. Already, brain waves recorded through electrodes on the scalp can flip a switch, allowing people with Lou Gehrig's disease and other paralyzing conditions to choose letters on a computer monitor and communicate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gallant and his team are often asked whether the technology could be used in detective work or court cases -- an idea that brings to mind the futuristic crime-foiling action in \"Minority Report.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the potential to watch a person's memories may not be so far off. Whether such memories could be used in a court of law, however, would be limited not only by the technology but also the nature of memories.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The president says we have to have another tax increase in order to avoid the sequester,” House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said at a news conference Monday. “Well, Mr. President, you got your tax increase. It’s time to cut spending here in Washington.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Boehner instructed Obama to “sit down with Harry Reid tonight and work with Senate Democrats.” As for House Republicans, they’ll be busy doing . . . well, not much. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Of the 56 days so far in 2013, the House has been in session for 20 — and a large chunk of those have been pro-forma sessions without votes, or with ceremonial bills. After a week’s recess, the chamber returned Monday with just a few items on the calendar. Lawmakers are scheduled to be out of town Friday, when the sequester is set to take effect. They’re planning another recess at the end of March, when the federal government is due to shut down for lack of funding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The House started its day Monday at 2 p.m. Before leading the Pledge of Allegiance, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) requested a roll-call vote on approving the journal of proceedings from the last day in session — a time-wasting technique. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next, Rep. Joe “You Lie” Wilson (R-S.C.) requested a minute of time to speak his mind, closing with his standard sign-off: “In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we’ll never forget September 11 and the global war on terror.” After Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) spoke about climate change, Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Tex.) had something to say about “the president’s takeover of health care.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) pleaded for the House to “abandon this reckless policy” of sequestration. Foxx, citing an op-ed by Bob Woodward in Sunday’s Washington Post, replied that the sequester “was the brainchild of the Obama administration” and that it is up to Democrats to replace it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was 2:10 p.m. — 10 minutes into the day’s proceedings — and the speaker called a three-hour recess. Finally, it was time for the NASA renaming. The task before the House: to put Armstrong’s name on the facility, relegating that of Hugh L. Dryden, a NASA engineer who died almost 50 years ago, to the facility’s test range. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bill passed the House in the last Congress by a vote of 404 to 0 (the Senate didn’t take it up), so it could have cleared the chamber with a simple voice vote. But that would not have eaten up much time. And so McCarthy and five other lawmakers chewed up almost half an hour on the floor praising Armstrong and Dryden. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lone Democrat to speak, Rep. Donna Edwards (Md.), noted the irony in the vote. “We will do our renaming today,” she said, and then “we will take an ax hammer to NASA’s budget on March 1, at the end of this week, taking out $894 million from an already strapped budget. I dare say future generations will not be inspired by what this Congress will do.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The speaker declared another recess.

Elizabeth Warren Grill Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Enlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facing off with the CEO whose massive bank appropriated customers' information to create millions of bogus accounts, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had sharp questions Tuesday for Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf. She said Stumpf made millions of dollars in the \"scam,\" telling him, \"You should resign ... and you should be criminally investigated.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As we've reported before, Wells Fargo is paying $185 million in penalties for acts that date to at least to 2011. The firm says it fired some 5,300 employees who were found to have created false accounts as it sought to increase \"cross-selling\" — building the number of accounts each customer holds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The exchanges between Warren and Stumpf were among the sharpest, but other senators also pressed the executive about what have become hot topics as public outrage has grown over the case. Here's some of what panel Chairman Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and others wanted to know: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether Stumpf regards the case as one of fraud NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether the bank will \"claw back\" any of the millions it has paid to former executive Carrie Tolstedt, who is retiring with nearly $125 million NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How the bank will help customers whose credit ratings have been hurt by the fake accounts NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Responding to those questions, Stumpf said he lacked the appropriate expertise, declaring himself at various times not to be a lawyer, a compensation expert or a credit consultant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Warren began her questioning by citing Wells Fargo's Vision and Values Statement, particularly its suggestion, \"If you want to find out how strong a company's ethics are, don't listen to what its people say, watch what they do.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"So, let's do that,\" Warren said. She then accused Stumpf of failing to hold himself or any other senior executives accountable for the company's actions. \"It's gutless leadership,\" she said, noting that Stumpf is not resigning, returning any of his earnings or firing any senior executives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Warren moved on to the subject of cross-selling — calling it a particular focus of Stumpf's tenure as CEO, citing his goal of eight accounts per customer and saying that cross-selling was \"one of the main reasons that Wells has become the most valuable bank in the world.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The senator asked Stumpf, \"Cross-selling is all about pumping up Wells' stock price, isn't it?\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No,\" the executive answered. \"Cross-selling is shorthand for deepening relationships,\" he continued — before Warren cut him off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She then produced 12 transcripts of Wells Fargo earnings calls Stumpf participated in from 2012 to 2014 — \"the three full years in which we know this scam was going on,\" Warren said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In all 12 of these calls, you personally cited Wells Fargo's success at cross-selling retail accounts as one of the main reasons to buy more stock in the company,\" Warren told Stumpf. She went on to quote him from the transcripts, as he touted the company's record growth to more than six accounts per household. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Warren asked Stumpf — who made $19.3 million in annual compensation (including a performance bonus of $12.5 million) in 2015, how much his stock holdings at Wells Fargo had gained during the period in question, the executive said that the information was all in the public record. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Warren then produced the information herself, saying that Stumpf held an average of 6.75 million shares in the company in that time frame — and that the share price had risen by about $30, \"which comes out to more than $200 million in gains, all for you personally, and thanks in part to those cross-sell numbers that you talked about on every one of those calls.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Here's what Warren said toward the end of her allotted time to question Stumpf: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Here's what really gets me about this, Mr. Stumpf. If one of your tellers took a handful of $20 bills out of the crash drawer, they'd probably be looking at criminal charges for theft. They could end up in prison. \"But you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers and you could drive up the value of your stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your own pocket. \"And when it all blew up, you kept your job, you kept your multi-multimillion-dollar bonuses, and you went on television to blame thousands of $12-an-hour employees who were just trying to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich. \"This is about accountability. You should resign. You should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. This just isn't right.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stumpf testified with a conspicuously bandaged right hand — it was particularly noticeable when he raised it to be sworn in Tuesday morning. A bank representative says he injured himself playing with his grandchildren. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During his allotted time to question Stumpf, Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., voiced skepticism at the idea that the 5,300 Wells Fargo employees who were fired had all acted independently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You state unequivocally that there are no orchestrated effort or scheme, as some have called it, by the company,\" Toomey told Stumpf. \"But when thousands of people conduct the same kind of fraudulent activity, it's a stretch to believe that every one of them independently conjured up this idea of how they would commit this fraud.\"\nPassage 2:\nSen. Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday called for a criminal investigation into Wells Fargo executives over the cross-selling scandal that has engulfed the bank and told CEO John Stumpf he should resign. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As her colleagues grilled Stumpf, Warren lit into the head of the nation's second-largest bank, saying reform won't come to the industry until executives are sent to jail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is about accountability,\" she said. \"You should resign, you should give back the money you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The only way that Wall Street will change is if executives face jail time when they preside over massive frauds,\" she added. \"Until then it will be business as usual, and at giant banks like Wells Fargo, that seems to mean cheating as many customers, investors and employees as they possibly can.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As Warren accused Stumpf of \"gutless leadership,\" Wells Fargo's stock price dipped. By midday. it was at $46.20 a share, up 0.43 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Warren's comments came amid testy questioning of Stumpf, who presided over what authorities have labeled as illegal cross-selling to millions of customers who often were enrolled into programs without their knowledge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She ripped into the culture that created the scandal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If one of your tellers took a handful of 20-dollar bills out of the cash drawer, they'd probably be looking at criminal charges for theft,\" she said. \"They could end up in prison, but you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they could cheat customers and you could drive up the value of hyour stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your pocket.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It wasn't a scam, and cross-selling is a way of deepening relationships,\" Stumpf said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Warren, who earned her reputation on Capitol Hill as a crusader for Americans against the financial services industry, is one of the scant few on the Senate banking committee who has not been cut a check by Wells Fargo's political action committee.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR\nPassage 3:\nDonald Trump is expected to announce that he plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital on Wednesday. The decision is, in some ways, a compromise. Trump had previously pledged to move the United States embassy to Jerusalem, a decision that would have set off an even greater international firestorm. The administration has insisted that it still plans to move the embassy to Jerusalem, but Trump will sign another six-month waiver, meaning that no change is imminent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the decision has been met with predictable criticism. Pope Francis called on the United States to respect the status quo in Jerusalem, which both the Israelis and Palestinians claim as their capital. The U.S. has historically insisted that Jerusalem’s status be resolved in peace talks; endorsing Jerusalem as Israel’s “undivided” capital will likely poison the well before talks have even begun. (West Jerusalem is predominantly Israeli, while East Jerusalem is largely Palestinian; pushes for a Palestinian state have typically called for East Jerusalem to be the capital of such a state.) Manuel Hassassian, the Palestinian representative to the U.K., told the BBC that recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital would be the “kiss of death” to the peace process. Violent protests are expected in response. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The decision comes amidst a broader shift in Middle East politics. The New York Times reported on Sunday that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presented Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian Authority, with a peace plan “that would be more tilted toward the Israelis than any ever embraced by the American government.” Per the Times: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Palestinians would get a state of their own but only noncontiguous parts of the West Bank and only limited sovereignty over their own territory. The vast majority of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which most of the world considers illegal, would remain. The Palestinians would not be given East Jerusalem as their capital and there would be no right of return for Palestinian refugees and their descendants. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Saudis have denied the contents of the report. But with both Saudi Arabia and the United States growing closer to Israel, it’s becoming increasingly doubtful that Trump will uphold his previous pledge to be a fair broker in negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n", "answers": ["Sen.

While more than 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were fired, none of the senior executives are losing their jobs.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nWhat happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and where is it now? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Statistical tools can’t answer those questions any more definitively than Malaysian officials have. Yet they can help refine and focus the hunt for the plane and for a solution to the deepening mystery of its March 8 disappearance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bayesian statisticians are particularly helpful in a search operation. Their methods allow hunters to update their estimates of the probability of finding their target in any latitude-longitude combination — or even in three dimensions, accounting for depth in the water. Bayesians helped hunt U-boats in World War II, a U.S. submarine in the 1960s and an Air France jet in 2011. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There’s a fourth dimension to the current search: the cause of the disappearance. New developments, such as information about how the plane’s communication systems were shut off, have lowered the probability that the plane disappeared because of an accident and increased the likelihood of deliberate diversion. Which explanation is the current leader, in turn, affects the probability of finding the plane at any given location: A deliberate act has made spots farther from the takeoff point of Kuala Lumpur more likely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bayesian inference formalizes what will seem, to many unfamiliar with it, like common sense. Its founding principle is that most new situations can be assessed and assigned probabilities: How likely is this restaurant to be good? How likely is this cough to be a cold? How likely is Duke to win the NCAA title? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Our first estimate of these probabilities may be no better than an educated guess. For example, we know that 60 percent of our restaurant meals in town have been good, or that Duke has won titles in four of the last 25 seasons (16 percent). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then we start layering new information. The restaurant is full. Now we can feel more confident in our choice: All of our good meals in town have been in full restaurants, but just half of our bad meals have been. What is the chance of a good meal, given that a restaurant is full? It’s 75 percent, based on this new information, since 75 percent of meals in full restaurants have been good. Before ordering, we check our favorite food-review website and see that the place has four and a half stars out of five. Every meal we’ve eaten at restaurants rated that highly has been good, but just half of our meals at restaurants with lower ratings have been. So we update our probability again, accounting for any overlap between full restaurants and highly rated ones — until we eat, when probability is no longer a relevant concept because our mouths are full. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Apply the same ideas to Duke, and you might examine the Blue Devils’ current ranking, their recent games, the probability FiveThirtyEight’s model and others assign to the team’s title hopes, and other tools to update that coarse, 16 percent probability. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR These examples require calculation of a single probability. Targeting a search in an area requires a probability estimate for every point in that area, really a probability distribution. Initially, we might guess that the probability is uniform: The object of interest is equally likely to be at any point. Then we update that distribution based on new information, such as — in the case of a missing plane — flight path, wind, ocean flow and which areas have been searched already. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This approach has informed water searches for sunken treasure, for men overboard and for plane-crash debris, said Lawrence D. Stone, chief scientist at Metron Scientific Solutions, who has worked on many of these searches. Among them: the hunt for the remnants of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people on board. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stone and his team’s methods helped inform a fifth Air France search two years after the crash, after four other efforts failed. Within six days, they found the wreck, and helped to show that the crash likely occurred because of pilot error in response to autopilot mode disengaging. After waiting nearly two years to understand their relatives’ disappearance, passengers’ families finally had answers. “We were very pleasantly surprised,” Stone said by email. “It doesn’t always happen this way.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the challenges is finding basic information about which areas have already been searched. “Search managers typically assume the search will be resolved quickly; only when it drags on do they realize they should have employed better record-keeping from the start,” Colleen M. Keller, a Metron senior analyst who worked with Stone on the Air France hunt, said by email. “Without good records, it will be very difficult for us to reconstruct and credit the current search effort.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even with ample data, Bayesian hunters must quantify subjective judgment, “using expert testimonies and imagination,” as Nozer Singpurwalla, a professor of risk analysis and management science at the City University of Hong Kong, put it in an email. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Metron team outlined its success in a paper that makes plain the subjectivity inherent to the approach. For instance, the team had to account for the possibility that an earlier search covered an area including the wreckage site but missed it. So they examined each prior search, one by one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the second search, in June and July 2009, two U.S. Navy ships listened for acoustic signals from beacons on the flight data recorder (also called the black box) and the cockpit voice recorder. Searchers designed the ships’ path to ensure that they got within 1,730 meters (a little over a mile) of every point in the area of the Atlantic they were scanning. Metron searchers had to calculate the probability that this search failed not because it was in the wrong area but because the beacons malfunctioned. This step alone, critical in determining how likely it was that a repeat search in that area would yield the wreckage, required several intuitive estimates, or educated guesses, if you like. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First, the scientists calculated the probability the beacon would be heard within 1,730 meters as at least 90 percent. Then they capped that probability at 90 percent, based on learning from past searches that “detection estimates based on manufacturers’ specifications and operator estimates tend to be optimistic.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I had been burned a couple of times before by optimistic sensor performance estimates,” Stone said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next they had to account for the possibility the beacons had been damaged in the crash. This, too, required extrapolating from past crashes, which yielded an 80 percent probability each beacon was unscathed. But how close together were the beacons — and if one beacon was damaged, was the other more likely to be? Or was the probability of either one being damaged independent? The scientists figured there was a 25 percent chance of independence and 75 percent chance of dependence. That, in turn, yielded a probability of 77 percent that if the wreck were in that area, the beacon search would have turned it up. And that was just one piece of one adjustment to the scientists’ estimate of where they might find the plane wreckage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This method may sound like making up numbers, but to advocates of Bayesian techniques, applying a rigorous framework to expert subjective judgment is valuable. “This is one of the strengths of the Bayesian method,” Stone said. “We did not have a thousand examples of AF447-like crashes to guide us. This is when the Bayesian approach is most useful.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are far fewer than 1,000 examples of past missing airplanes to guide the current search — just 80 since 1948, according to the Aviation Safety Network. Only two planes in the last seven years disappeared for at least 10 days: Adam Air Flight 574, in 2007; and Air France Flight 447. That makes subjective judgment a crucial input into the search, whether it’s being done qualitatively, or quantitatively using Bayesian methods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keller said Metron isn’t involved in the Malaysia Airlines hunt. If it were, the same principles would apply: Start with all data, such as radar, visual or acoustic measurements, transmissions from the plane and so on. Then update to account for unsuccessful searches, and keep updating as new information comes in. “Bayesian search theory allows flexibility in this way and even accommodates conflicting information,” Keller said. “Nothing is discounted.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The extra layers of complexity in the Malaysia Airlines search — the new estimates of the plane’s location, mounting evidence that a deliberate act caused the disappearance — complicate the Bayesian calculations and estimates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bradley Efron, a Stanford University statistician, said the complications make Bayes a bad fit for the Malaysia Airlines hunt. “Bayes’ Rule is good for refining reasonable (or at least not unreasonable) prior experience on the basis of new evidence,” Efron, who also expressed skepticism to Al Jazeera America, wrote in an email. “It is not good when new evidence changes the situation drastically.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Tony O’Hagan, professor emeritus of probability and statistics at the University of Sheffield in the U.K., said that’s the perfect situation for Bayesian techniques, which should make searchers most effective in adapting to changing information, so long as they properly assume from the get-go that the plane might not be in the initial search area. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other advocates of Bayesian stats pointed to their usefulness in bringing discipline to what can be a difficult search process. Citing the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky on decision-making, O’Hagan said, “People have two modes of thinking. There’s a quick, instinctive mode and a slow, thoughtful mode. When problems are important enough, we need to force ourselves into the second mode — and Bayesian methods are exactly what we need.” He added, “It is likely that Bayes’ theorem would adjust faster than people would tend to do using quick-mode thinking” — because people can get locked into their quick conclusions, while Bayes slowly and steadily tacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Arnold I. Barnett, a statistician at the MIT Sloan School of Management, worries that people who use the tools without fully understanding them may be led astray, “that the very act of quantifying a probability obscures the point that the numerical estimate is itself subject to uncertainty,” he said. “Thus the estimate might be taken more literally than is warranted.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the widespread use of Bayesian methods in searches, not every airline or government uses them — there’s no evidence the Malaysian government nor Malaysia Airlines has in the current search, though they are getting help from a team of French government investigators who worked on the Air France hunt. (The Malaysian embassy in Washington, D.C., didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment, and calls to the embassy on Monday yielded an automated reply that the office was closed because of snow.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I suspect that they just guess, like professional baseball managers used to do before ‘Moneyball,’” said Peter Thall, a biostatistician at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CORRECTION (March 18, 11:30 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Metron joined the search for Air France Flight 447 two years after the crash. Metron joined earlier; a search based on its Bayesian calculations that found the wreck began two years after the crash.

Could mathematical techniques inspired by an 18th Century Presbyterian minister be used to locate the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June 2009, Air France flight 447 went missing flying from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to Paris, France. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Debris from the Airbus A330 was found floating on the surface of the Atlantic five days later, but the mystery of why the plane crashed could only be answered by finding the black box and the cockpit voice recorder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR You may think that having found the debris it would be easy to find the rest of the plane, but it's not that simple - after a number of days, the material would have moved with the ocean current. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Software does exist that can simulate how the debris has travelled from the initial impact. It is used regularly by the US Coast Guard. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But in this case, because this area near the equator is known for unpredictable currents - particularly at that time of year - it was no help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Debris from the Air France crash is laid out for investigation in 2009 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR American, Brazilian and French ships, planes and submarines all searched for the plane, but they couldn't find it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At this point France's aviation accident investigation authority, BEA, made a call to a group of statisticians in the US who had expertise in finding objects lost at sea. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Senior analyst Colleen Keller flew to France to help.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They also had lots of data about historical crashes and the results of the searches that had already been carried out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To turn all this information into numbers and probability, Keller and her team from Metron Inc in Virginia, relied on Bayesian statistics named after a British Presbyterian minister called Thomas Bayes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This type of thinking allows you to assess various scenarios at once - even contradictory ones. The probability of each being true is brought together to give you the most likely solution. And if you find new information, you can revise your model easily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Keller and her colleagues went through all the available information and assessed the uncertainties of each piece of data - applying Bayesian principles of probability to work out the most likely location of the plane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The team split up the search area into a grid, and applied to each cell a figure representing the probability that the plane would be found there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption A Brazilian Air Force radar plane prepares to leave Fernando de Noronha airport to search for Flight 447 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To calculate these figures, they first looked at the theories about what caused the plane to crash. For instance, they assessed the likeliness of various mechanical failures, and came up with a probability for each scenario. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They then assessed historical data from previous crashes, noting, for example, that planes were usually found very close to where they were last known to have been. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, Keller and her team lowered the probability of the plane being found in locations that had already been searched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are two components to Bayesian maths which make it unique. It allows you to consider all the data you have including the uncertainties which is very important because nothing is certain,\" says Keller. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"And to combine it all - it even allows you to combine views that contradict each other. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"For instance with the Malaysian search, you have that arc to the north and the arc to the south. It's either one or the other but it can't have gone both ways, but [Bayes] allows you to preserve all your theories and weight them.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The second benefit is that the Bayesian approach is very flexible, Keller says. It allows you to update your body of knowledge at any time. If something new comes up, you factor it in and update the probability map.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The probability map Keller provided gave, by contrast, a much tighter area to search. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A team went out there, hoping that finally the mystery would be solved. But those hopes were dashed. There was no sign of the plane. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It seemed the statisticians could not help after all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some months later, though, Air France got back in touch and asked Keller to make one last attempt to analyse the data. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This time, she and her colleagues decided they were not happy with one of their initial assumptions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The historical data showed that after a crash, the black box will be emitting a signal in 90% of cases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the immediate aftermath of the crash, search teams had spent a lot of time sweeping the areas close to the last known location, listening for the ping of the black box or voice recorder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They had heard nothing. So Keller and her team had decided there was a very low probability the plane would be found there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But what if neither the black box nor the voice recorder were sending a signal?

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A catastrophic terrorist strike at the Sochi Winter Olympics would present the United States with a logistically mind-boggling and diplomatically delicate challenge: How to get more than 200 American athletes safely out of Russia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. military officials have described plans to use two warships in the Black Sea and planes already on standby in Europe to evacuate Americans if the worst fears of security experts come true. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But these are the Olympics of President Vladimir Putin, who is spending a reported $50 billion on the games, including a purportedly impenetrable “ring of steel” around the Olympic city, and who sees the games through a prism of national pride. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Any American rescue operation would depend heavily on his approval, security experts say. And that’s unlikely if not impossible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NBC News' Richard Engel reports from inside the difficult-to-reach Coastal Cluster in Sochi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As far as being able to do things without Russian cooperation, it’s basically a nonstarter,” said Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a former Russia expert in the Clinton White House and an NBC News analyst. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is their territory, their country,” he said. “They get to decide what kind of outside help they need.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fears of Olympic terror have grown in the countdown to the games, which formally open Feb. 7. In the past week, a militant video has promised a “surprise” in Sochi, and Russia has hunted for at least five suspected terrorists who may have designs on an attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday, police said they had killed a senior Islamist militant in Russia's North Caucasus as they hunted three Muslim women dubbed “black widows” and other terror suspects ahead of the Winter Olympics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So while Putin’s ring of steel may help thwart larger coordinated attacks, experts are warning that lone attackers also pose a significant threat to the Games. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Gordon Woo, terrorism expert at risk management modeling firm RMS, analysis shows that terror plots involving up to 10 operatives have a 5 percent chance of succeeding. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ezra Shaw / Getty Images Snowboarder Kelly Clark at a competition earlier this month. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Smart terrorists\" rein in their ambition and aim for simpler plots with fewer operatives, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The U.S. Olympic Committee declined to discuss the details of security for the American athletes or what would happen in the event of an evacuation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The safety and security of Team USA is our top priority,” Patrick Sandusky, a USOC spokesman, said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As is always the case, we are working with the U.S. Department of State, the local organizers and the relevant law enforcement agencies in an effort to ensure that our delegation and other Americans traveling to Sochi are safe,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But at least part of the American contingent for Sochi, the skiing and snowboard teams, is paying a private company, Global Rescue, for additional security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The company promises communications help, “rally points” for athletes to shelter in place and ways to get them around, or out of, Sochi. Dan Richards, the CEO, said in an interview that Global Rescue has six aircraft that it could “utilize for rapid response.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Exactly how that would work — a private security company landing its planes in or around Sochi in the immediate aftermath of an attack — is not clear, and Richards declined to provide details of the company’s plans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Global Rescue also offers its services to individuals and companies, and in recent years has helped customers during the Arab Spring, the earthquake in Haiti and the tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Counterterrorism analyst Michael Leiter says transportation in Russia is vulnerable in the high-threat areas surrounding Sochi. The terrorists who previously launched an attack, he said, have every incentive to do so again. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In every major crisis we’ve been involved with, we’ve never had host governments deny us overflight or landing permission,” he said. “The likelihood is that we’ll all work together, the Russians, our government, other friendly government and other private companies.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Richards would not say what the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association is paying for the additional protection. The skiers and snowboarders are among the richer American teams. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The American luge team — 10 athletes and four coaches, plus medical and support staff — will rely on the U.S. Olympic Committee, said Gordy Sheer, the team’s director of marketing and sponsorship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They’re working pretty hard, and we’ve been given a lot of assurances,” he said in a phone interview. “I feel that the USOC is really making it a priority, and obviously the Russians are as well.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are signs of concern among American athletes. Some, including at least two members of the high-profile hockey team, have told their families not to travel to Sochi to cheer them on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m actually really concerned about it,” Zach Parise, one of the hockey players, told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis-St. Paul. “I know they say they have evacuation stuff for us and all, but you just never know. I guess you have to wonder at what point does someone say it isn’t a good idea for us to go.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The biathlon team has bought satellite phones for its coaches and is recommending that traveling families of its 10 athletes purchase medical and evacuation insurance — the same already provided to Olympic athletes by the USOC — should anything go wrong, said Max Cobb, president and CEO of U.S. Biathlon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other American athletes say their minds are on getting ready for competition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’m not worried about any safety issues in Russia at this point,” said Kelly Clark, a snowboarder competing in her fourth Winter Games. “We’re so focused on our competition and on our sport.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. officials say the terror threat is higher than at any previous Olympics. The State Department will have diplomatic security officers in Sochi, though it has declined to say how many, and the FBI will have a presence as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Evan Vucci / AP file President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin last June. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The Russian government has the lead here for security,” Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters. “Obviously we’ve said we’re happy to assist in any way we can, certainly for American citizens.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Barack Obama spoke with Putin this week about Olympic security, and Russia has raised the possibility of the Americans’ sharing bomb-detecting technology for the games. That would mean having American military personnel on the ground to help. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But senior defense officials told NBC News on Wednesday that there was little or no chance that the technology could be in place in time. It would take months to train the Russians, and there has been no discussion of using the system in Sochi under total American control, they said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And the Olympics take place at a time of frayed U.S.-Russian relations — tested by the Edward Snowden affair and the Boston Marathon bombings — not to mention the long shadow of the Cold War. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A large-scale attack would trigger almost unimaginable complications, said Weiss, the Russia expert. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For example: At least 85 countries and 2,500 athletes are taking part in the games. Sochi has a fairly small airport, so who gets to fly out first? And why should the Americans be given priority? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Something that looks like the U.S. cavalry riding to rescue Russia or Vladimir Putin from an attack seems — well, it’s just hard to imagine that happening,” he said. “Ultimately, it’s all on Russia.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Catherine Chomiak, Courtney Kube, Jim Miklaszewski, Andrea Mitchell and Michele Neubert of NBC News contributed to this report.

But some countries' teams will be providing their athletes with even more security, worrying that the level of danger in Sochi is higher than at any previous Olympics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some 2,000 athletes will participate in the Games, and about 213,000 visitors are expected to come to Sochi, which borders Russia's turbulent North Caucasus republics. The Games will be held in the wake of two recent suicide bombings that killed 34 people in Volgograd, 700 kilometers north of Sochi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many nations said that while they were concerned about the Volgograd attacks, they would primarily count on the Russian authorities to provide security during the Games. Part of the U.S. team, however, has hired a private security firm for its athletes, while the U.S. government has sent FBI agents to Sochi and Moscow for the duration of Games and made air and naval assets available to help Russia prevent possible terror attacks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several groups have threatened to attack the Sochi Olympics, the latest being a group that calls itself Vilayat Dagestan, which also claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings. They said the attacks were ordered by rebel leader Doku Umarov, who has also threatened to strike Sochi during the Olympics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In response to the possible threats, the U.S. ski and snowboard team has hired private security firm Global Rescue to protect its athletes in case of emergency. Global Rescue head Daniel Richards said Sochi was a unique environment with challenges that his firm had not experienced at the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, in 2006 or Vancouver, Canada, in 2010, when its security agents also worked for the U.S. team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the Sochi Games, the firm will have five aircraft on standby to assist the team in case an emergency requires an evacuation. Richards said it would be one of the firm's larger deployments for the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association given the scale and the location. \"Our planning with them began months ago,\" he said by e-mail. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Global Rescue is also providing athletes with guidelines to minimize the possibility that they would become targets and develop protocols and strategies they can use to deal with events that might occur while they are in Sochi. He said his firm's team would work with Russian state agencies as necessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Britain has also said it will provide additional security to its Olympic team by sending security staff to Sochi as part of its delegation, but said the move is not related to last month's attacks in Volgograd. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alexander Demianchuk / Reuters A ski lift operating at a Sochi venue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We will rely primarily on the security provided by the Games Organizing Committee and the host country,\" the British Olympic Association said in a statement following the Volgograd bombings. \"As with previous Olympic Games, we will have security personnel as part of our delegation. That has been in our planning all along.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The statement said that in the interests of secrecy, neither the exact number of security personnel nor where those individuals will be based would be disclosed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russia's security services are taking what some observers say are unprecedented measures to provide sufficient protection from would-be attackers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some 40,000 police officers will be used to provide security during the Olympics, and Russia's 58th Army unit, which is composed of about 70,000 soldiers, will patrol Russia's nearby southern border with Georgia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By comparison, at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, some 13,000 police officers and 17,000 soldiers were used for security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Security is to be ensured by some 40,000 law enforcement and special services officers,\" President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with foreign media on Sunday. \"We will protect our air and sea space, as well as the mountain cluster. I hope things will be organized in such a way that they do not catch the eye and will not, so to say, depress the participants in the Olympic Games.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some nations, even those that have experienced tragedy at past Olympics, say that they consider these measures sufficient and that they will not be sending additional security for their teams. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel, which saw 11 of its Olympic team members taken hostage and later killed by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, is among them. Vladimir Shklyar, head of the Israeli delegation to the Sochi Olympics, said by phone that Israel was confident that Russian security agencies would do their job properly and that the Games would be safe. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A spokesman for the German Olympic Sports Federation said Germany also trusted Russian authorities to provide excellent security in Sochi. \"But we will look closely with our German national security authorities on the situation in Sochi, because in the modern world you can never be 100 percent confident that there will be no emergency situations,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spokesman said he could not reveal whether German security officials would be a part of the German delegation or would observe the situation from Germany. When asked whether the team would use the services of a private security firm like Global Rescue, he said: \"We will have no aircraft, that is all that I can say.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A representative for the Dutch Olympic Committee said he could not comment on whether the Netherlands would take any additional security measures but said: \"We take security seriously, just like the authorities in Sochi.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From Sweden, only one special pair could demand a security detail — and it is not the star athletes from their cross-country skiing squad. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We rely on the host country's authorities — only the king and queen can get additional security personnel,\" said a spokesman for the Swedish Olympic Committee.\n", "answers": ["The US has sent two warships to the Black Sea and put planes on standby in Europe as it prepares to evacuate its Olympians from Sochi in the event of an attack.

The US skiing and snowboarding teams have signed up their own private security company, Global Rescue, which claims it has six aircraft ready for an evacuation if necessary. But having planes isn't the only issue; it's having runways. Sochi's airport is fairly small, so deciding which of the 85 countries competing to use it would be a nightmare. Other teams are also taking special security precautions, the Moscow Times reports. Britain, for example, is sending extra security personnel with its delegation.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New York property heir has steadfastly insisted that he is innocent in the death of Susan Berman.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9:15 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A federal judge in New Orleans has approved a plea agreement for real estate heir Robert Durst to serve 7 years, 1 month in prison on a weapons charge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Judge Kurt Engelhardt approved the sentence Wednesday. The 72-year-old Durst agreed to the sentence as part of a guilty plea in February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Durst still faces a separate murder charge in California. He is accused of killing a female friend in 2000 to keep her from talking to prosecutors about the disappearance of Durst's first wife in 1982. Durst has steadfastly maintained his innocence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ___ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Real estate heir Robert Durst will soon learn whether a federal judge accepts a 7-year-and-one-month sentence on a weapons charge that's kept him in Louisiana pending a murder trial in California. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Judge Kurt Engelhardt will say Wednesday whether he approves that sentence, which the 72-year-old Durst accepted as part of his guilty plea in February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He's charged in California with killing his friend Susan Berman in 2000. His attorneys have said repeatedly that Durst is innocent, doesn't know who killed Berman, and wants to prove it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The most recent such statement was in a motion Monday asking U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt to recommend that Durst serve his time at Terminal Island, California, about 30 miles from downtown Los Angeles, where Durst faces trial in Berman's death.\nPassage 3:\nFrail Robert Durst sentenced on gun charge in New Orleans but headed to low-security federal prison in L.A. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Frail Robert Durst sentenced on gun charge in New Orleans but headed to low-security federal prison in L.A. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Robert Durst, the New York real-estate heir and celebrity murder suspect who twice chose New Orleans as a hideout, moved closer Wednesday to escaping another hot Louisiana summer behind bars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt sentenced the ailing Durst, 73, to an agreed-upon 85-month prison term on a federal gun count resulting from a search of his room last year at the JW Marriott hotel in downtown New Orleans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A call from the hotel to retrieve his voicemail drew authorities, who were pursuing Durst, the subject of the then-running HBO miniseries “The Jinx,” in the 2000 execution-style slaying of his longtime confidante and spokeswoman, Susan Berman, in Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Engelhardt endorsed a recommendation sought by Durst’s attorneys for him to serve his sentence at a low-security federal prison facility on the Pacific coast while he awaits state prosecution for Berman’s murder. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Durst, appearing frail in orange St. Charles Parish jail scrubs, reurged that request before Engelhardt on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I’ve been waiting to get to California for a year so I can state my not guilty” plea in Berman’s killing, Durst said. “If there’s anything you can do to speed up that process, I would truly, truly appreciate it. I am not guilty of murdering Susan Berman.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a legal filing this week, his attorneys cited Durst’s “advanced age and poor health” in their request for him to be housed at FCI Terminal Island, a federal prison with medical facilities near Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An elaborate deal with federal prosecutors, confected as part of Durst’s guilty plea in February to a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, would have him back in California by Aug. 18 for his arraignment in the murder case. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael McMahon said Wednesday that it’s likely Durst will leave within a few weeks for California, assuming the federal Bureau of Prisons accepts the judge’s recommendation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The gun charge stemmed from a search of Durst’s hotel room on March 14, 2015, which turned up a flesh-colored latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair, five ounces of marijuana, more than $100,000 in cash and a loaded Smith and Wesson .38-caliber revolver, authorities said. His attorney said Durst has forfeited those items, including the cash, as part of his plea deal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Following his guilty plea in February, McMahon said he suspected Durst had been headed to Cuba to try to evade arrest in Berman’s killing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Engelhardt had held Durst’s guilty plea in abeyance pending a probation report that recommended a sentencing range of just 12 to 18 months on the gun charge. But Engelhardt, in formally accepting the deal Wednesday, noted that it also includes stipulations that authorities in New York won’t prosecute him over financial maneuvering while on the lam, and that prosecutors in Texas and New Orleans won’t pursue further gun counts against him related to his stay in New Orleans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dick DeGuerin, Durst’s longtime attorney, said the deal “cleared the decks, at a cost. It’s a serious cost, but he’s not facing any other prosecution except what’s in California. That’s what this is all about. We want to get to California and go to trial.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DeGuerin, describing Berman as Durst’s “best friend,” again insisted that Durst didn’t kill her and doesn’t know who did. He said Los Angeles prosecutors have not revealed any new evidence in the case but that he’s confident Durst will beat the murder rap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He didn’t do it. That’s as confident as you can get,” DeGuerin said outside the federal courthouse Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Renewed interest in Durst for Berman’s killing stemmed from the conclusion of the HBO show. In the final episode, Durst made what some observers described as a confession while muttering to himself off-camera, still wired with a microphone on a trip to the bathroom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course,” Durst said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show cataloged three presumed killings of which Durst has been suspected: Berman’s slaying 16 years ago; the killing of a Texas neighbor, Morris Black, for which Durst was acquitted, despite dismembering Black and dumping his remains in Galveston Bay; and the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen Durst, in New York in 1982. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Durst was a felon because of guilty pleas in 2004 to interstate transportation and possession of a firearm by a fugitive of justice. He had jumped bail in 2001 after being charged in Black’s killing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While on the lam, he moved for a time to New Orleans, where he rented an apartment under a woman’s name, court records show. Authorities later found a wig used to support his alias and a money clip that had belonged to Berman.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The final GOP-authored House Benghazi report released Tuesday included new details of a two-hour video teleconference call the night of the attack, a session led by White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. Clinton and top Defense officials were also on the call, which was supposed to center on how to get Americans out of harm's way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But a substantial part of the discussion, GOP investigators said, centered on how and why the attack happened rather than narrowly examining potential rescue plans. Half of the action items people wrote down in the meeting didn't have to do with evacuation; many of them were about an anti-Islam video, which the administration would incorrectly blame for the violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report also found that a State official brought up a question about whether Marines should wear civilian clothing instead of their uniforms. Under secretary of State for management Patrick Kennedy told investigators he wanted to ensure that security was enhanced, not hurt by flags on the uniforms of any U.S. military presence.

The proximate cause of the violence was the release by individuals in the United States of the video trailer for a film that many Muslims find offensive. Diplomatic compounds have been breached in several countries including Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen. In Benghazi, Libya four U.S. personnel were killed in the violence[.]\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The administration, including Secretary Clinton, knew that Benghazi was a terrorist attack—from witness accounts, from their understanding of the history of violence in Benghazi, and from the nature of the well-planned, complex attack. Yet, they led the public to believe the video and a protest were to blame in Benghazi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 9/20—Public Statements NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Excerpt from interview of the President on Univision Town Hall: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In response to the question, \"We have reports that the White House said today that the attacks in Libya were a terrorist attack. Do you have information indicating that it was Iran, or al Qaeda was behind organizing the protests?\" the President answered, \"[W]e're still doing an investigation[.] . . . What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests[.]\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secretary Clinton has since blamed her statements on changing information received from U.S. intelligence reports. She and others have claimed that the 10:08 p.m. statement was not meant to ascribe a motive to the attack. Yet, Sullivan knew the morning of September 12th—based on the press release from the embassy in Kabul—that people had heard it exactly that way. Moreover, whether or not the intelligence information changed, Secretary Clinton's public and private statements remained unchanged—publicly tying Benghazi and Cairo together and privately recognizing the violence in Benghazi was a terrorist attack with nothing to do with a protest or video. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moreover, to the extent any intelligence analysis incorrectly reported on a protest or a video in connection with Benghazi, Secretary Clinton and other State officials, who knew better, simply ignored them. As just one example, in her conversation September 15, 2012 with the president of Libya, Secretary Clinton made no mention of anything in the CIA talking points that administration officials later claimed were the best assessment available at the time, and those talking points made no mention of a video in connection with Benghazi. In short, Secretary Clinton and the administration knew better than to rely on flawed intelligence reports. Intelligence assessments may have changed. News reports may have changed. But the eye witness accounts remained same—and not one said a protest had occurred. Yet, once Secretary Clinton and Ben Rhodes set the message, the truth became an afterthought.\nPassage 3:\nThese crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times.

How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

(AP) — A former detective testified Monday that a police bloodhound detected traces of a slain University of Virginia student inside the apartment and on the car door of the man charged in her killing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to media outlets, former Louisa County Sheriff's Office Detective Buck Garner also said the bloodhound found 18-year-old Hannah Graham's scent at an industrial site about a mile from downtown Charlottesville. He said the dog alerted him to a scent indicating \"fear and adrenaline,\" suggesting that Graham may have been attacked near a mulch pile at the site. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new details emerged in a daylong pretrial hearing for Jesse Matthew Jr., 34, who is charged with capital murder in Graham's 2014 disappearance and death. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Matthew also faces first-degree murder charges in the 2009 death of 20-year-old Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington. He is serving a life prison term for a 2005 attempted murder and sexual assault in northern Virginia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Garner testified at length Monday about his involvement in the early days of the Graham investigation working with a 7-year-old bloodhound named Shaker. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He described following Shaker as the dog traced Graham's scent to Charlottesville's downtown, where she was last seen. Surveillance video from businesses showed Graham walking alongside Matthew. Her remains were found six weeks later on an abandoned property in Albemarle County, about 12 miles from campus. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Garner testified that Shaker at one point traced a long route east from the Downtown Mall to the industrial site. During a subsequent search, Garner said, Shaker detected Graham's scent on the passenger door of Matthew's vehicle, in the doorway to his home and near a dumpster at his apartment complex. Garner said the dog did not find Graham's scent near other apartments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bloodhound's work provided the basis for police to obtain a search warrant for Matthew's apartment and vehicle. Defense attorney Doug Ramseur unsuccessfully challenged the search warrant in court, arguing that the search dog's findings were inconsistent with witness accounts and video surveillance evidence, that detectives might have misled a magistrate to obtain the warrant and that there was not probable cause for police to conduct those searches. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Albemarle County Circuit Judge Cheryl Higgins ruled there were no \"instances of deliberate misstatements and reckless disregard\" of the truth in the affidavit supporting the search warrant and, although the dog's findings may have had inconsistencies, there were other arguments in the six-page affidavit that could constitute probable cause. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She read some of those points out loud: Witness statements put Graham and Matthew together on the night of her disappearance, at least one witness said she saw the two go to a bar on the Downtown Mall, and Matthew bought them each drinks using his debit card.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nA convicted white-collar criminal was sentenced Wednesday for persuading his son to shoot him in the leg as part of a staged insurance scam a day before he was to set to start serving a decade-long federal prison term from a high-profile mortgage fraud case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown called Shannon Egeland's insurance scheme and concocted shooting, which led to the amputation of his left leg, \"an unthinkable kind of situation,'' and tacked on three years and 10 months to his 10-year sentence for mortgage fraud. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The additional time resulted from Egeland's guilty plea in May to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the elaborate insurance scam, and for interstate failure to pay child support. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egeland, who stood on a prosthetic leg before the judge in U.S. District Court in Portland, said he's spent time reflecting the past 3 ½ years he's been in custody, and has realized he's in need of mental health counseling and treatment. He's now taking three mental health-related medications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What bothers me the most is my son - the pain is on him,'' Egeland said. \"The pain that he has shouldn't be there...I've had 3 ½ years to recognize I am broken...If I could take it all back, I would, but I can't...That will haunt me the rest of my life.'' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On July 31, 2014, Egeland directed his son Rylan Egeland, then 17, to shoot him in the leg with a shotgun along a roadside in Caldwell, Idaho, hoping to delay his prison sentence and benefit from a bogus disability insurance policy that he had applied for seven days earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The son shot Egeland in his lower legs and then left the scene. Egeland called 911 and claimed he was a victim of assault when he stopped to help a pregnant motorist. He told authorities he was suddenly hit in the head and shot along the side of the road. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egeland previously had pleaded guilty to fraud charges for his role in the Desert Sun housing scandal that rocked Central Oregon in 2009. Egeland was a co-owner of Desert Sun, which raised millions from local banks through a series of phony business plans and falsified loan applications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, prosecutors sought a five-year sentence for the insurance scam while Egeland's lawyer urged a two-year sentence to be served consecutive to the 10-year sentence he's already serving. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Bradford described Egeland in a sentencing memo as a \"menace to society,'' who has been on a crime spree since 2004. Egeland came up with the trumped-up shooting plan to delay his prison sentence in the mortgage fraud case and benefit from fraudulently obtained disability insurance, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bradford called Egeland a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist,'' motivated by greed who recklessly manipulated his son. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The psychological and emotional destruction defendant caused this minor child is unimaginable,'' Bradford wrote in the memo. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egeland had his teenage son obtain a 20-gauge shotgun, while Egeland got the ammunition and directed his son to shoot him in the legs on July 31, 2014. Seven days earlier, Egeland had submitted an application for a disability insurance policy to Standard Insurance, falsely claiming he had never been arrested or indicted for either a felony or misdemeanor in the prior 10 years, according to court records. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Standard Insurance did not suffer an actual loss because the fraud was quickly detected, Bradford said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While on pretrial release in the mortgage fraud case, Egeland was accused of delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school in December 2010 and a year later, of perjury, accused of lying on the witness stand in the drug trial, prosecutors said. He was convicted of both at trial, but the Oregon Court of Appeals overturned the drug conviction because of a jury instruction problem.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nSince posting our first update, we have been working as quickly as possible to establish the facts of last week’s accident. Our hearts are with the family and friends who have been affected by this tragedy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The safety of our customers is our top priority, which is why we are working closely with investigators to understand what happened, and what we can do to prevent this from happening in the future. After the logs from the computer inside the vehicle were recovered, we have more information about what may have happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the moments before the collision, which occurred at 9:27 a.m. on Friday, March 23rd, Autopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum. The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision. The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The reason this crash was so severe is because the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced. We have never seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over a year ago, our first iteration of Autopilot was found by the U.S. government to reduce crash rates by as much as 40%. Internal data confirms that recent updates to Autopilot have improved system reliability. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the US, there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers. For Tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware. If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tesla Autopilot does not prevent all accidents – such a standard would be impossible – but it makes them much less likely to occur. It unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR No one knows about the accidents that didn’t happen, only the ones that did. The consequences of the public not using Autopilot, because of an inaccurate belief that it is less safe, would be extremely severe. There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year. We expect the safety level of autonomous cars to be 10 times safer than non-autonomous cars. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the past, when we have brought up statistical safety points, we have been criticized for doing so, implying that we lack empathy for the tragedy that just occurred. Nothing could be further from the truth. We care deeply for and feel indebted to those who chose to put their trust in us. However, we must also care about people now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that Autopilot improves safety. None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer's family and friends. We are incredibly sorry for their loss.\nPassage 2:\nEMBED More News Videos A 38-year-old man was killed when his Tesla crashed and caught on fire in Mountain View.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nRobin Williams, who died unexpectedly today at 63, was hugely admired among his own generation -- the genuine affection in the room, say, when he won his \"Good Will Hunting\" Oscar speaks to just how well-liked he was in Hollywood. And yet unlike many of his contemporaries, Williams had a particular impact on the slice of the population now in our mid-to-late 20s and early 30s. Through the 1990s, Williams, an established film star, shifted into a new gear in his career; he generously and humbly took on entertainment for kids. Williams will be remembered for his edgy comedy and for dramatic turns, but for people my age, Williams was our childhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams' filmography in the 1980s and early 1990s is full of prestige projects (\"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" \"Awakenings,\" \"Dead Poets Society\"), but something shifted with \"Hook\"; the movie about Peter Pan rediscovering the joy of Neverland had the same effect, perhaps, on Williams, who'd always been wacky and loose on-screen but was suddenly acting like he'd never grown up. It took a fairly humble A-lister to play a supporting role in an animated film at a time when voice acting was an anonymous profession, and a fairly brave comic known for working blue to abandon anything that wasn't safe for young children. And yet Williams' performance as the Genie in \"Aladdin\" was straightforwardly a triumph, lending one of Disney's grimmer stories its imaginative expansiveness. Without Williams, it's impossible to imagine \"Aladdin\" becoming the VHS classic it was through the 1990s; people in my age bracket, even those who may not be able to quote chapter and verse, can easily call to mind the sense of fun and comfort Williams' voice conjured. He was generous enough to erase his recognizable face and body entirely, and yet as a blue drawing was more vivid and lifelike than the vast majority of TV characters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Again and again, Williams went to extremes in his desire to please. In \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" simply one of the best family films ever made, the actor buried his face under makeup and his body in a fat suit in order to pull off physical comedy that felt, for kids, somehow illicit. We weren't supposed to be seeing something so strangely charged, even if the moral (about parental love) was brought home safely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Certain themes emerged. In \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" Williams plays a voice actor who's too childlike to sustain his marriage to Sally Field; in \"Jumanji,\" Williams played a man who'd been trapped inside a board game since childhood and who'd never lived in the real world; in \"Jack,\" he played a boy trapped in the body of a man; in \"Flubber,\" he was a professor unable to deal with the very real pressures of running a lab and bedeviled by magical, fun green goo. It hardly needed to be made this explicit to the children in the multiplex seats or, more likely, watching on Blockbuster rental that Williams was like us. He was strangely innocent of adult-world concerns and, better yet, he was utterly unselfish about lowering himself to the level of kids. What he found funny was funny to his audience, who cared not at all about his Oscar nominations or public profile or past comedy career. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the century turned, Williams got interested, again, in serious projects, but it didn't help that the mid-budget adult drama was beginning its disappearance. He'd been out of leading-man roles in adult movies for so long that something was off his fastball -- movies like \"Jakob the Liar\" and \"Bicentennial Man\" had conceits (a man tries to spread hope among his friends with fanciful lies during the Holocaust; a robot can live forever but just wants to be human) that were two degrees removed from the sunny, high-concept optimism of kids' movies. (He'd lately, fittingly enough, rebooted his children's movie career as Theodore Roosevelt in the \"Night at the Museum\" movies.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It hardly mattered, though, to the now-early-teens who'd been raised on Williams' movies. For them -- for me -- Williams has a place in the pantheon simply by virtue of being that rare star who seemed excited to work on projects we cared about. Giving joy is as important as evoking tears or provoking thought, and Williams' legacy, perhaps, can be measured in the imprints his movies left in rec-room carpets, as kids parked in front of the TV rewound his movies again and again.\nPassage 2:\nFate threw me in Robin Williams' path more than once, and I never forgot any of the encounters. He was such a wired, complex, brilliantly funny individual, no connection with him was anything like ordinary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though Williams, who died Monday at age 63, appeared in dozens of films, getting Oscar nominated for four performances and finally winning for 1997's \"Good Will Hunting,\" it was as a dazzling, unknown stand-up comedian that I first met him. In a pair of linked meetings, he made an impression on me that in an unnerving way connects in my mind to the tragic way his life ended. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The year was 1978, I was a freelance journalist newly arrived in Los Angeles when an editor I knew at Rolling Stone called me with a quick last-minute assignment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A TV show called \"Mork & Mindy\" was being filmed, and though it hadn't aired yet, the word was already out that its star, a young comedian named Robin Williams, was going to break out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In addition to filming the show, Williams was doing occasional stand-up at the Comedy Store on Sunset Boulevard. Would I catch one of his shows, do a brief interview and write a small story for the magazine? Who could say no to that? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asphyxia from an apparent suicide is what officials are initially saying is the cause of death for 63-year-old comedian Robin Williams, ahead of an official coroner's report. Asphyxia from an apparent suicide is what officials are initially saying is the cause of death for 63-year-old comedian Robin Williams, ahead of an official coroner's report. See more videos NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Comedy Store was half-asleep and half-empty that night, Williams was the last performer on the bill, and did he wake the place up. The astounding routine he went into would defy description even if I could remember it word for word. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He took on different characters with different accents, roamed to all kinds of locations, both physical and metaphysical, made lightning-fast comic connections in time and space that were at once hysterically funny and like nothing I had ever experienced before. It was no surprise people in the know were buzzing about Robin Williams, no surprise at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the show Williams and I had a quick bite in a bustling place on the Strip called the Copper Kettle. It was jammed with people, and absolutely no one cared or even looked up when he walked into the room. How are you going to handle it, I asked him, when your show airs and everyone knows your name, when you won't be able to walk into a place like this without causing a firestorm. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oh no, Williams insisted, stubbornly — or perhaps nervously, at this point I can't be sure — refusing to acknowledge the tsunami everyone around him knew was headed his way. That's not going to happen, he said, confidently shaking his head, nothing like that is ever going to happen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cut to several months later. \"Mork & Mindy\" is the hottest show on television, and Williams is the talk of the town. I was covering the AFI Life Achievement Award for the Washington Post and, by pure chance, walked into the hotel entrance right behind Robin and his date. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I tapped him on the shoulder, he turned around and gave me a big surprised grin. So, I asked him, as the line to the ballroom snaked forward, how has this celebrity business turned out for you? He was about to say something when we turned a corner and the mass phalanx of photographers caught sight of him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Robin, Robin, look this way, Robin, over here,\" they screamed in a \"Day of the Locust\" frenzy as waves of flashbulbs flashed in unison. Robin smiled, waved and mugged and then all of a sudden turned back to me. With the brilliant improvisational mind that defined him, he said something in a stage whisper that was immediately recognizable as a riff on the terrifying plea for help that closes the 1950s science fiction classic \"The Fly.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Help me, Ken,\" he said in a perfect imitation of the film's tiny, doomed fly voice. \"Help me.\" Then he turned back to the photographers and was gone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Because it was as stand-up of genius that I first encounter Williams, that's how I always thought of him, even when he transformed into a formidable actor Oscar-nominated for \"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" \"Dead Poets Society\" and \"The Fisher King\" before his \"Good Will Hunting\" triumph. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It always seemed to me that the restlessness, the search for experience and knowledge that characterized his comedy as well as his very physical presence compelled him to go into drama, to take on not only comic roles but also dark ones. Roles that in some ways seemed out of character with his stand-up voice but from another point of view fit right in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I ran into Williams one more time, several years later at a press lunch at the Cannes Film Festival where he was in full performance mode, keeping a table full of journalists roaring with laughter at the frenzied nimbleness of his attack. But even at those high-octane moments, even when he won his Oscar, I could never get that \"Help me\" moment out of my mind. When word came in Monday about his death, the thought of it made me shudder, it really did.\n", "answers": ["After Robin Williams' sudden death, the tributes are rolling in, with many recalling a comic genius grappling with private challenges. A sampling: When it comes to comedy, \"there wasn't a faster brain on the planet,\" writes Tony Hicks in the Contra Costa Times. We'll be hearing \"a litany of tributes about one of the great comedians who ever lived. Much of it will be some of the same adjectives used when any great performer dies—especially before their time.

Police were seeking Caballero in the killing of Markus Austin, whose body was found in the apartment complex's parking lot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caballero is believed to have boarded a bus on Sunday in White River Junction. Police said the bus was headed to New York City but had several intermediate stops where he could have gotten off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caballero and Austin had been involved in an altercation outside Gustos bar in Barre earlier Sunday morning, police said. During the altercation Austin assaulted Caballero's girlfriend, witnesses said. Caballero later confronted Austin outside Austin's apartment and shot him, police said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caballero's girlfriend, Desiree Cary, was arrested Sunday evening in Barre, where Caballero lives. She appeared in court Monday, pleaded not guilty to drug charges and was released. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Montpelier has about 7,500 residents, making it the nation's least populous capital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police Chief Anthony Facos said the shooting death of Austin was the first murder in the city since the 1920s, when a woman shot her husband. He did not have additional details of that case.\nPassage 3:\nMONTPELIER — A judge has granted police an arrest warrant for the killing of a Montpelier man early Sunday morning, but the suspect remains at large and may have fled the state, according to police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vermont State Police Maj. Glenn Hall said police have an arrest warrant for Jayveon Caballero, 29, of Barre, for second degree murder. Bail has been set at $500,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Caballero may have fled the state, according to Hall. Police are not sure if Caballero is traveling by vehicle. Anyone with information about his location or the shooting is asked to contact the Vermont State Police. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The victim, 33-year-old Markus Austin, was shot outside his apartment at 191 Barre Street in Montpelier around 4:30 a.m. Sunday morning. Hall said Monday that they have since learned that Caballero and Austin knew each other and were involved in an altercation outside the Gustos bar on Prospect Street in Barre prior to the shooting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hall said the altercation involved several others, some of whom have been interviewed by police. Hall said detectives received information during their investigation that Caballero’s girlfriend, Desiree Cary, was assaulted by Markus Austin during the altercation at the bar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hall said Caballero then confronted Austin outside the Montpelier apartment building and shot him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cary, 22, who was the target of an ongoing drug distribution investigation by the Vermont Drug Task Force, was taken into custody following a motor vehicle stop in Barre Sunday evening, Hall said. She has been held in custody for lack of $10,000 bail and faces charges of selling crack cocaine and heroin. She is scheduled to be arraigned in Washington County Superior Court Criminal Division this afternoon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cary lives with Caballero at 1099 South Barre Road in Barre, where a Vermont State Police Tactical Services unit and detectives executed a search warrant early Monday in an attempt to take Caballero into custody.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first eclipse of 2018 will be a lunar one that comes at the very end of the month, on Jan. 31. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It will be a total eclipse that involves the second full moon of the month, popularly referred to as a Blue Moon. Such a skywatching event hasn't happened for more than 150 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The eclipse will take place during the middle of the night, and the Pacific Ocean will be turned toward the moon at the time. Central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand and most of Australia will get a fine view of this moon show in the evening sky. Heading farther west into western Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Eastern Europe, the eclipse will already be underway as the moon rises. [Super Blue Blood-Moon 2018: When, Where and How to See It] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To the east, Alaska, Hawaii and northwestern Canada will see the eclipse from start to finish. Moonset will intervene for the rest of North and Central America, however. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Below, we provide a timetable for the main stages of the moon's passage through the Earth's shadow for six time zones — one for Hawaii (HST), one for Alaska (AKST) and four across the U.S and Canada: Pacific (PST), Mountain (MST), Central (CST) and Eastern (EST). All times are a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Timetable for the main stages of the Jan. 31, 2018, blue moon total lunar eclipse, for six time zones. Credit: Joe Rao/Space.com NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Along the U.S. West Coast, the total phase begins at 4:51 a.m. PST. The farther east you go, the closer the start of the partial phases will coincide with moonrise. Along the U.S. Atlantic Seaboard, for instance, the moon will have only just begun to enter the darkest part of Earth's shadow, the umbra, at 6:48 a.m. EST when it will disappear from view below the west-northwest horizon. The duration of the total phase is 77 minutes, with the moon tracking through the southern part of the Earth's shadow. So, during totality, the moon's lower limb will appear much brighter than the dark upper limb. [In Photos: The Snow Moon Lunar Eclipse & Comet 45P Encounter] NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How unusual are Blue Moon eclipses? To answer that question, we consulted the reference book Canon of Lunar Eclipses, 1500 B.C. - A.D. 3000, by Bao-Lin Liu and Alan D. Fiala (Willmann-Bell Inc., 1992).

Both of these eclipses will be total. Before 2017, there was an 8 percent partial eclipse on Dec. 31, 2009, but, for a total eclipse of a Blue Moon, we have to go all the way back to March 31, 1866. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, the upcoming eclipse on Jan. 31 will be the first total eclipse of a Blue Moon in nearly 152 years! NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR We will have more to say about January's eclipse here at Space.com in the coming weeks.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And that’s exactly what astronomy fans are being treated to this winter. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The first supermoon appeared when the moon swung by Earth 26,500 km (approximately 16,500 miles) closer than usual on Dec. 3. It will reappear as a visible supermoon on New Year’s Day 2018 and again on Jan. 31. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Visible supermoons appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon’s orbit. If you only have time to catch one episode of the trilogy, NASA recommends catching the last one, which will be extra special. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not only is the second full moon of a month considered a blue moon, the Jan. 31 supermoon will also feature a total lunar eclipse, with totality visible from eastern Asia across the Pacific to western North America. During the eclipse, the moon will slowly lose its brightness and take on a reddish hue because of the way the atmosphere bends the light, says NASA. As a result, totally eclipsed moons are sometimes also called “blood moons.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When can I see the supermoons and the lunar eclipse? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The best time to enjoy either supermoon is right after moonrise and before sunrise, when the moon is sitting on the horizon. It will appear its biggest and brightest because of a “moon illusion” effect that’s created when you are able to compare the lunar body to other objects for scale, like buildings and foliage. Check your local moonrise time here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Don’t worry if you miss the moonrise—you can continue to enjoy a larger-than-average moon for a few more days. It just won’t be a full moon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the night of Jan. 31, the lunar eclipse will begin at 11:48am UTC and reach its maximum at 1:30pm UTC. That means viewers who live in eastern North America will need to wake up early to catch the partial eclipse. Here’s a map of where you can see the eclipse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ruaraidh Gillies/Wikimedia Commons From supermoon to blood moon. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Can I see the supermoon and lunar eclipse without going outside? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If it’s too cloudy, or too cold to go outside, there are options to beam either celestial event straight to your living room. The Virtual Telescope project provides a livestream of the Jan. 1 supermoon rise over Rome’s skyline, beginning at 4:00pm UTC, and the Jan. 31 eclipse from Australia, beginning at 11:30am UTC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What’s the best way to photograph the supermoon or lunar eclipse? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To take a picture of the supermoon or the lunar eclipse with a smartphone, tap on the moon on the screen and hold your finger in place to lock the camera’s focus. Then adjust the exposure slider that appears next to your finger to get the right balance of light for your shot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If you’re using a DSLR, NASA’s senior photographer Bill Ingalls recommends that you use the daylight white balance to adjust for the sunlight being reflected off the moon. He says that it’s important to keep in mind that the moon is a moving object. “It’s a balancing act between trying to get the right exposure and realizing that the shutter speed typically needs to be a lot faster.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bill Ingalls/NASA A supermoon behind the Colorado State Capitol Building on Sunday, Sept. 27, 2015. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR To get an original shot, Ingalls suggests taking a picture that puts the moon in context of a local landmark, something that gives your photo a sense of place. “Don’t make the mistake of photographing the moon by itself with no reference to anything,” say Ingalls. “Everyone will get that shot.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Do I need special glasses to watch the supermoon or the lunar eclipse? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fortunately, unlike the solar eclipse, the supermoon and the lunar eclipse are safe to view with the naked eye! There’s nothing to worry about if you find yourself enthralled and staring up into the sky for a very long time.\n", "answers": ["Look up at the sky on Jan. 31 and you may witness a sight unseen for 150 years. For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ambassador Robert Ford visited Hama \"to make absolutely clear with his physical presence that we stand with those Syrians who are expressing their right to speak for change,\" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hama has been wracked with violence and a general strike this week after a series of peaceful demonstrations, including a huge anti-government demonstration last Friday. A fierce crackdown ensued in the area, with activists and Human Rights Watch reporting many arrests and deaths. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Bashar al-Assad fired the Hama provincial governor Saturday and security forces removed tanks to the outskirts of the city, a sign that the tensions there could be easing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ambassador Ford met with over a dozen Hama residents and visited a hospital that has treated some of those wounded in the security forces crackdown, Nuland said, adding that he was greeted with a \"very warm welcome.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The state news agency SANA reported that a Foreign Ministry source accused Ford of going to Hama without obtaining prior permission from the government. According to the report, the Foreign Ministry official said Ford's visit was \"clear evidence of the U.S. involvement in the ongoing events in Syria and its bids to aggravate the situations which destabilize Syria.'' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nuland, however, said U.S. officials notified the Syrian government that an embassy team was traveling to Hama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The embassy informed Syrian officials that an embassy delegation, without specifying whom, would be heading to Hama. And they then proceeded to make their way there and were allowed to proceed,\" Nuland said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ford's delegation did not include any official Syrian \"handlers,\" Nuland said, adding that Syrian authorities allowed him through check points to reach the town. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"For him to go personally at this time and stand with the people of Hama, I think expresses in physical terms -- not to mention political terms -- our view that the people of Hama have the right to express themselves peacefully and that we are concerned about the posture that the security forces have taken,\" Nuland said, adding that Ford plans to stay through protests planned on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is unclear whether Hama residents will turn out for nationwide demonstrations on Friday after Muslim prayers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month, Hama was the site of violent crackdowns by security forces that killed 60 protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The city is a sensitive spot for Syrian authorities. In 1982, it was the scene of a brutal military crackdown targeting Sunni Muslims by the Alawite-dominated government of Hafez al-Assad, the current president's late father. Thousands were killed, with Human Rights Watch putting the toll at 10,000.\nPassage 2:\nReports of biggest crowd in Syria so far in city at heart of opposition, as activists say 13 dead across country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 500,000 Syrians flooded through the city of Hama on Friday, according to activists, in what they claim was the single biggest protest yet against the embattled government of President Bashar al-Assad. The opposition reported 13 protesters killed, including five deaths in the central city of Homs, two in the capital's commercial neighbourhood Midan and six in the Dumair area, east of Damascus. Syrian state-run TV said the deaths in Damascus and Homs were caused by snipers from \"armed gangs\". An activist told Al Jazeera that Hama, where marchers were seen carrying olive branches, had become a \"tangible example of resistance to injustice\" in Syria. Hundreds of thousands also protested last Friday in Hama, prompting mass arrests and reports of several deaths when Syrian security forces stormed the city, Syria's third largest, and the surrounding area. \"Hama, with all the support it is receiving from all over the country, is becoming a role model for peaceful demonstrations and we are protesting here for all of Syria,\" the local activist said. Western solidarity Friday's protests followed a visit to Hama by Robert Ford, the US ambassador to Syria, who toured the city on Thursday to show solidarity with residents, the US State Department said. Ford reached the city after passing checkpoints run by the military and Hama residents. A US official said Ford left Hama on Friday afternoon to avoid becoming a distraction during the weekly demonstrations. Diplomats said on Friday that French ambassador Eric Chevallier was also in Hama to show support. Damascus accused Washington of \"interfering\" in its affairs. \"The presence of the US ambassador in Hama without previous permission is obvious proof of a clear evidence of the United States' involvement in current events in Syria and its attempt to incite an escalation in the situation, which disturbs Syria's security and stability,\" the Syrian foreign ministry said in a statement. In response, the US state department said: \"The fundamental intention was to make absolutely clear with his physical presence that we stand with those Syrians who are expressing their right to speak for change.\" In another development, Washington summoned the Syrian ambassador for talks this week after reports that embassy staff had filmed US protests against the crackdown in Syria. Ambassador Imad Mustapha was called in to meet with top State Department officials \"to express a number of our concerns with the reported actions of certain Syrian embassy staff in the United States\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mustapha met with Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell on Wednesday, according to a State Department statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fleeing Hama An estimated 1,000 Syrians have fled Hama in fear of another military crackdown on protests calling for Assad to quit and an end to the Baath Party's decades-long grip on power, a rights group said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the residents had evacuated to Salamiyah, a town 30km from Hama, on Thursday. The rights group claimed that security forces have killed at least 23 civilians there and conducted mass arrests since Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ammar Qurabi, head of the National Organisation for Human Rights, said on Wednesday that an influx of troops following the massive Friday protest had brought a dramatic escalation of \"killings and arrests in the city\". But Al-Watan, a state-run newspaper, said on Thursday that the situation in Hama was calm and the barricades erected in the streets by protesters to keep security forces out had been dismantled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The newspaper said authorities had told demonstrators to avoid any confrontations and clear the streets so residents could go to work. They also told protesters to avoid a \"last resort\" military operation, the paper said. Hama has been a symbolic city of opposition since the 1982 crackdown on a revolt by the banned Muslim Brotherhood against then-president Hafez al-Assad, father of the current leader. At least 20,000 people are believed to have been killed in the crackdown. There has also been violence in the city of Hasrata just outside Damascus where three people have been killed and nine injured by security forces, sources told Al Jazeera.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BOSTON — This rattled city was grappling Tuesday with the painful process of identifying its dead, a strong police presence on its streets, and a firm resolve to heal and move forward. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One day after two bombs rocked the finish line of the Boston Marathon and the nerves of residents and tourists here, police promised \"significantly enhanced\" security at bus and train stations and airports. And the mayor promised that the city won't be intimidated by terror. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We're going to make sure the city pulls together,\" Mayor Thomas Menino said Tuesday. \"Boston's a strong city. ... Boston will overcome.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tuesday evening, the third victim was identified as a Boston University graduate student from China who was watching the race with two friends near the finish line. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Chinese Consulate in New York confirmed the student's death, the Associated Press reported Tuesday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The university did not release the student's name or gender, pending family approval. But the official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that relatives have requested that the student not be identified. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One friend was injured and listed in stable condition at a Boston hospital. The other friend was not hurt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Earlier Tuesday, restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, was the second fatality identified. Martin Richard, 8, was identified Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Campbell's father said the Medford, Mass., resident had gone to the finish line Monday afternoon to photograph a friend completing the run. William Campbell said his daughter, who worked at a restaurant, was \"very caring, very loving person, and was daddy's little girl.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tuesday afternoon, Campbell's grief-stricken mother, Patricia, spoke briefly from the front steps of their home in the Boston suburb of Arlington. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Everybody that knew her loved her,\" she said, weeping, supported by a young man. \"You couldn't ask for a better daughter.... I can't believe this has happened. It doesn't make any sense.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Across the city, the Salvation Army mobilized four mobile kitchens and more than 30 people to provide food, drinks, and emotional and spiritual care. The First Corps of Cadets Armory in downtown Boston, unofficially known as \"The Castle,\" became a staging area for runners looking for their gear bags, trying to find lost phones and passports or trying to make travel arrangements. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Valerie Kelly, 28, a schoolteacher who lives in Boston, stopped in at the armory. She said the course was closed before she could finish the race. Fortunately, none of her students at the finish line to greet her were injured. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was really hard to register. You work so hard for this moment of glory, and you're going through so many emotions,\" she said. \"Then you go from that to you can't finish and then you immediately go from that to 'Oh my God, are my family and students OK?' \" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, there were small signs of a return to normalcy Tuesday. The sealed crime scene centered at the intersection of Boylston and Exeter streets shrank from 15 blocks to 12. Planes, trains and automobiles were running at or near normal operating schedules. Airlines at Boston's Logan International Airport were even waiving change fees for customers scheduled to fly there during the next few days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some runners, their gait a little off from their brutal run a day before, took recovery runs Tuesday to work out the kinks. Others, wearing the blue and yellow running jackets issued to runners, walked the streets of Back Bay, about a quarter mile from the finish line. They made their way past a chorus line of Boston police, state police and ATF agents and barricades. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A handful of people wearing business clothes moved along sidewalks too, although most businesses remained closed and the mood was subdued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A pall also hung over the wood-frame Dorchester home of victim Martin Richard. His mother and sister were seriously injured. On Tuesday, neighbors or even strangers walked or drove up to leave flowers or balloons on the front steps. Police set up yellow tape to prevent the press from getting too close, and a Boston police sergeant took gifts to the home for the visitors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One group of people — two adults and two children — who left balloons held onto one another as they walked away. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The blasts occurred just before 3 p.m., just hours after Ethiopia's Lelisa Desisa won the 26.2-mile race Monday. Bloodied spectators were carried to a medical tent intended for runners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Organizers stopped the race and locked down the marathon headquarters. The Federal Aviation Administration announced a temporary flight restriction over Boston. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The tragedy brought words of encouragement and solidarity from across the nation — and around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR President Obama praised first responders and others who helped the injured. \"If you want to know who we are, what America is, how we respond to evil, that's it: selflessly, compassionately, unafraid,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president will travel to the city Thursday for an interfaith service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Pope Francis sent word Tuesday to Cardinal Sean O'Malley, archbishop of Boston, that he was \"deeply grieved\" by the bombings. The pope said he \"invokes God's peace upon the dead, his consolation upon the suffering, and his strength upon all those engaged in the continuing work of relief and response.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Francis also prayed that all would be \"united in a resolve not to be overcome by evil, but to combat evil with good, working together to build an ever more just, free and secure society for generations yet to come.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Boston, District Attorney Daniel Conley couldn't agree more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Moments like this, and our response to them, define who we are,\" Conley said \"In the past 24 hours, the city of Boston has shown strength, compassion and determination to see justice done.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bacon reported from McLean, Va.

(Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By sheer numbers, the USA handily leads the world in obesity, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people — 13% of the total for a country with 5% of the population, a new report says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But we are hardly alone in our battle with bulges: Obesity is a growing problem worldwide and, by proportion, is even worse in some other countries, says the study to be published Thursday in the medical journal Lancet. Rates are rising among men, women and children, in rich countries and in poor countries, the report says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's going up everywhere,\" says study co-author Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington-Seattle. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new 188-country study is the most comprehensive look at obesity worldwide over the past several decades, and it paints a discouraging picture, Murray says: \"The most concerning thing is that there's not a single country that has seen a decline in obesity in the past thirty years. … We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto. But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obesity is more common in developed countries than in poorer nations, but it is rising in both, the report says. Throughout the world – including in the USA – obesity co-exists with pockets of hunger, Murray says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the details: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR •The number of overweight or obese individuals worldwide increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013. That's nearly 30% of the world's population, up from about 20%. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR •About one-third of adults in the USA are overweight (with a body mass index of 25 or above), and another third are obese (with a body mass index of 30 or above), as has been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR •Obesity rates are even higher in some countries, exceeding 50% among men in Tonga and among women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Samoa and Tonga. \"Those are extraordinary levels,\" Murray says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR •About 22% of girls and 24% of boys in developed countries are overweight or obese. So are 13% of boys and girls in developing countries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR •In the USA and other developed countries, increases in obesity have slowed; in developing countries, rates are accelerating. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The new study does not examine causes but lists possibilities, including increased calorie intake, changes in diet composition, decreased physical activity and even changes in the mix of bacteria that live in human guts in the modern world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report notes that population-wide weight gains and income gains generally go hand in hand around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That seems to support a theory, advanced by another recent study, that a major cause of obesity is that food has become cheap relative to income. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's not just cheaper in terms of money. It's also more accessible and more available all the time in the form of prepackaged junky food that is not necessarily conducive to health,\" says Roland Sturm, a senior economist at RAND and co-author of that study, published last week in CA: Cancer Journal for Clinicians. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a good thing that hunger has decreased,\" Sturm says, \"but now we have to deal with another health issue.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This month, the World Health Organization launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and suggest solutions.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR WASHINGTON Obesity is imposing an increasingly heavy burden on the world's population in rich and poor nations alike, with almost 30 percent of people globally now either obese or overweight - a staggering 2.1 billion in all, researchers said on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers conducted what they called the most comprehensive assessment to date of one of the pressing public health dilemmas of our time, using data covering 188 nations from 1980 to 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nations in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America and the Pacific and Caribbean islands reached staggeringly high obesity rates, the team at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle reported in the Lancet medical journal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The biggest obesity rises among women came in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras and Bahrain. Among men, it was in New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The richest country, the United States, was home to the biggest chunk of the planet's obese population - 13 percent - even though it claims less than 5 percent of its people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obesity is a complex problem fueled by the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles. It is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, diabetes, arthritis and certain cancers. Chronic complications of weight kill about 3.4 million adults annually, the U.N. World Health Organization says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During the 33 years studied, rates of being obese or overweight soared 28 percent in adults and 47 percent in children. During that span, the number of overweight and obese people rose from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That number exceeds the total world population of 1927, when it first hit 2 billion. Earth's population now tops 7 billion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The researchers said obesity - once a malady of rich nations - now grips people of all ages, incomes and regions, with not one country succeeding in cutting its obesity rate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" said Marie Ng, a global health professor who was one of the researchers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The problem was most acute in the Middle East and North Africa, with more than 58 percent of adult men and 65 percent of adult women overweight or obese. Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait saw big increases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have to remind ourselves that obesity is really not a cosmetic issue. It's a main risk factor for morbidity and mortality,\" added global health professor Ali Mokdad, another of the researchers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Obesity is appearing at increasing young ages, rising nearly 50 percent in children and adolescents worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Men tallied higher rates in developed countries. Women did so in developing countries. There was a possible ray of hope in rich countries, with the rate of increase in adult obesity slowing in the past eight years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than half of the world's obese live in just 10 countries: the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan and Indonesia.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Toronto police source told The Globe and Mail that a real estate agent who had been helping to sell the Shermans' North York home – it was recently listed for $6.9-million – discovered the bodies on Friday morning.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ms. Sherman was warm, genuine and loved to socialize. Mr. Sherman was a renowned workaholic, not comfortable with small talk and occasionally let on that he would rather go to the dentist than attend another fundraiser. But he always showed up because it was important to his wife. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Sherman talked business with a handful of friends at a reception in Toronto a few weeks ago for federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, a party hosted by Senator Linda Frum. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At that party, Mr. Sherman made it clear that he still loved what he was doing and had no plans to leave Apotex, according to a Bay Street executive who knew the couple well.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Shermans have handed out millions of dollars to hospitals, universities and the United Jewish Appeal. Ms. Sherman was on the board of governors at York University, the Baycrest Foundation and Mount Sinai Hospital. She was also the past chair of the Jewish Foundation of Greater Toronto and former chair of the Holocaust Education Centre. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rhonda Lenton, the president of York University, last saw the Shermans on Oct. 28 after a concert by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra at Toronto's Roy Thomson Hall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The couple were in a buoyant mood that night, Dr. Lenton recalled, especially the more outgoing Ms. Sherman.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egyptians voted in the third round of parliamentary elections today as prosecutors began their case in the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak by describing him as a “tyrant” responsible for violence and oppression. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The final stage of the vote, the first since Mubarak was ousted in February, covers nine provinces including the North and South Sinai governorates. Islamist groups are expected to consolidate the gains they made in earlier rounds, in which the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice party took the lead ahead of the more conservative Nour party, which represents Salafi Muslims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The third phase will not change much the nature of the upcoming parliament,” Nabil Abdel Fattah, director of the Al- Ahram Center for Social and Historic Studies in Cairo, said in a telephone interview. “It will likely underline the control of Islamists.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The election and Mubarak’s trial, which resumed last week after a two-month hiatus, take place amid growing opposition to the ruling generals, who say they won’t cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June. It’s unclear what powers the elected assembly, due to hold its first session on Jan. 23, will have and how a new government will be formed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clashes in Cairo last month between security forces and demonstrators calling for an earlier end to military rule left at least 17 people dead. Protesters are preparing to take to the streets on Jan. 25 to mark the anniversary of the mass rallies that drove Mubarak from power. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Slowing Growth NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The new parliament will witness political struggles between the military council, the Brotherhood and Salafis, and the revolutionary forces,” said Abdel Fattah. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Economic growth has slowed as the unrest deters tourists and investors. Foreign-currency reserves declined by 44 percent to $20.2 billion in the first 11 months of 2011. The benchmark EGX 30 stock index (EGX) lost 49 percent last year, making it the third-worst performer among world markets tracked by Bloomberg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 14 million voters are eligible to vote in this round, and 150 parliamentary seats are up for grabs.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Oppression and Violence’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutor Moustafa Soliman told the court Mubarak was a “tyrant” who sought to install his son, Gamal, in his place, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. His trial is a reminder to future rulers that they will be held accountable for breaking the law, the prosecutor said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mubarak allowed former Interior Minister Habib el-Adli to “practice oppression and violence against Egyptians so he could remain in office,” Soliman said, according to MENA. Police seeking to block protesters from reaching Cairo’s Tahrir Square targeted their heads and chests, and some were run over by police vehicles, he said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As the polls opened, some analysts suggested that the party founded by the Brotherhood, Egypt’s mainstream Islamist group and best-organized political force, could come away with a clean majority of the seats in the full Parliament instead of the plurality indicated by previous results. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some estimates indicated that the Brotherhood’s party, Freedom and Justice, started the day with nearly 50 percent of the seats awarded in the first two rounds of the vote. It won roughly 40 percent of the seats allocated by party voting, and a higher percentage of the seats contested by individual candidates. And the final nine governorates voting on Tuesday included the historic Brotherhood strongholds of Gharbiya and Daqahliyya in the Delta, where a number of the group’s best known candidates are running, including the former member of Parliament Mohamed Beltaggi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Final results remain uncertain, in part because Egypt’s military rulers have yet to spell out the formula that will be used to allocate seats among parties according to their share of the vote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an interview Tuesday, Essam el-Erian, a Freedom and Justice leader who was elected to parliament from Giza, said he still doubted the party would win more than half the seats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Nothing is impossible but it would be very difficult,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Still, the Brotherhood has played down its electoral strength before. In the weeks after Mr. Mubarak’s exit last February its leaders suggested that the Brotherhood would seek only a third of the seats in the next Parliament and it is not contesting most of them and expecting to win at least 40 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Brotherhood has said repeatedly that it intends to form a coalition or unity government, in part to avoid unnerving Egyptian liberals or Westerners who may fear an Islamist takeover. It may also wish to share the responsibility for what is expected to be a difficult period of adjustment for the Egyptian state and economy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But winning a clear majority would enable the Brotherhood’s party, if it chose, to govern without forming a coalition. And removing the necessity of such a coalition government would diminish the power of the partners in any alliance as well as any other parties outside the coalition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That would reduce the clout of the ultraconservative Islamists who have so far come in second-place in the first two rounds of the voting, winning as much as 25 percent of the seats by most estimates. And it would also reduce the voice of the various liberal parties, led by the business-friendly Free Egyptians and the left-leaning Social Democrats, who have won most of the remainder of the seats. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Brotherhood has so far sought to ally itself with the liberals rather than the most conservative Islamists and it has reiterated that it has no plans to form an all-Islamist government. The strength of the ultraconservatives, known as Salafis, has been the biggest surprise of the voting so far. Many espouse hard-line views seeking sharp reductions in the sale of alcohol, opposing women’s participation in political leadership or public life, and potentially restricting arts and popular culture deemed profane or sacrilegious. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisement Continue reading the main story NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tuesday’s voting also sets up an potential confrontation between the new Parliament and Egypt’s military rulers. Brotherhood leaders have said they expect the Parliament to take authority over the hiring and firing of a prime minister to run the interim government. The military rulers have said they intend to retain that authority and allocate very little power to the Parliament. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lower house of Parliament is Egypt’s primarily legislative body, and Field Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the top military officer who is now acting as de facto chief executive, has scheduled its first session for Jan. 23, two days before the anniversary of the outbreak of protests that ousted Mr. Mubarak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With the same anniversary looming over Mr. Mubarak’s trial, prosecutors began to lay out their case that he was culpable for the hundreds of people killed by security forces during the 18 days of protests that ended his rule. Human rights lawyers representing those killed in the shooting have complained with growing alarm that the prosecution has failed to push hard enough or marshal a strong enough case to win a conviction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Tuesday the prosecutor appeared to argue for Mr. Mubarak’s punishment with new vigor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity — from the presidential palace to the defendants’ cage and then the harshest penalty,” the prosecutor, Mustafa Suleiman, told the court, according to a report from a journalist from The Associated Press inside the courtroom. (The authorities have strictly limited access.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Witnesses said he spoke with his back turned to Mr. Mubarak and his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, who were corralled in the metal cage that is the standard docket in Egyptian criminal courts. All three face charges of using official positions to enrich themselves. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In laying out his case that Mr. Mubarak was responsible for the deaths of demonstrators, the prosecutor also focused attention on Gamal Mubarak, who had become an important powerbroker in the ruling party and his father’s heir apparent before the revolution. The notion of hereditary success was to many Egyptians an outrage too great to bear, just as similar schemes to pass power within a ruling family have apparently proven too much for the citizens of Tunisia, Libya and Syria as well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Here we have a president who devoted the last decade of his rule to engineer something that no one in Egypt ever dared to do before — the succession of his son,” said the prosecutor declared, according to a report from The A.P. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Mubarak was once again wheeled into the court room on a hospital gurney, his head resting on a pillow, and remained prone for what his lawyers have said were health reasons.\nPassage 3:\nThe chief prosecutor in Hosni Mubarak's trial accused the ousted Egyptian leader on Tuesday of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last 10 years of his three decades in power to ensure his son would succeed him.

On trial with Mubarak are his two sons, Gamal, his one-time heir apparent,... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mustafa Suleiman's comments came in the first of three days in which the prosecution will state its case against Mubarak and 10 other defendants, including his two sons, his security chief and a close associate of the ousted leader who is now a fugitive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trial began Aug. 3 but has been bogged down in procedural matters, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding Judge Ahmed Rifaat be removed. That request alone took a separate court about three months to rule on and was eventually denied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters in the crackdown on a popular uprising that forced him out of office on Feb. 11. The two sons, Alaa and one-time heir apparent Gamal, face corruption charges in the same case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With his back to the defendants' cage, Suleiman delivered a scathing critique of Mubarak's rule, branding the 83-year-old a corrupt man whose lust for power will for ever tarnish his legacy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity _ from the presidential palace to the defendants' cage and then the harshest penalty,\" said Suleiman, whose hour-long comments mesmerized the courtroom, set up at a police academy that once bore the former leader's name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the corruption of Mubarak's regime peaked shortly before the anti-Mubarak uprising broke out in January last year, when authorities engineered what is widely viewed as the most fraudulent parliamentary election seen in Egypt since the army seized power in a 1952 coup. Mubarak's ruling party won all but a handful seats in the November-December vote in what Suleiman described as part of a strategy to succession. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A banker-turned-politician, Gamal began his climb to power in 2000. By the time the 18-day uprising broke out on Jan. 25, he was effectively in charge of the Cabinet and the ruling party, wielding more powers than the prime minister. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Here we have a president who devoted the last decade of his rule to engineer something that no one in Egypt ever dared to do before _ the succession of his son,\" said the prosecutor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mubarak could face the death penalty if convicted of complicity in the killing the protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mubarak was succeeded by military generals beholden to the former leader for their ascent through the military ranks. They are led by a general who served Mubarak for 20 years as defense minister. Many within the protest movement believe Mubarak and his two sons were only arrested and put on trial under pressure from a series of massive protests to demand that the three be held accountable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While the two sons are held in a prison south of Cairo along with nearly 40 stalwarts of the toppled regime, Mubarak has since his arrest in April been held in hospital under custody.
